"2","Dinner last night was like one of those amazing first dates where everything goes just right and you don't want the evening to end. I woke up today with butterflies in my stomach as I reminisced about every delicious detail. My spectacular date last night was with Reservations Gourmet-To-Go which is located in the eclectic neighborhood of Seminole Heights. Owned by Anthony and Elke Catania, it is a hidden gem that serves exquisite dishes made with local ingredients. Words can't express how much I enjoyed my meal last night. Every dish was prepared with love and passion and that is why I give them five stars.

Open Monday through Saturday from 11:30 am until 6 pm, they offer a fantastic lunch menu as well as catering. A few weeks ago they launched their Reservations After Dark with an intimate dinner service offered on Saturday nights from 6-10pm. Each week the menu is a special selection of unique dishes made with local ingredients.

My friend and I each started with a small plate. He ordered the Lobster Bisque which was savory and creamy with chunks of fresh lobster. I only had a taste, but it was spectacular and he really enjoyed it. The presentation was simple and elegant. I opted for their Prosciutto, Sweet Fig, Parmesan Reggiano, Chive and Radicchio. Every item on this dish is one of my favorites and I was really impressed with this selection. The combination of the sweet figs and prosciutto was simply intoxicating. Food porn at its best, this dish left me wanting more.

For the main course, my friend went with their Grilled Rib Steak with Jalapeño Butter. Served atop grilled bruschetta and adorned with fingerling potatoes and sautéed spinach, it was fantastic. Now, I am a medium-rare girl and he ordered his medium-well, which to me is a sin.  Nevertheless, I tried a bite and it was spectacular. The jalapeño butter was a unique blend of salty and spicy and I could not stop raving about it. It just melted into every nook and cranny and accentuated the flavor of the succulent steak. Magnifico!

I had their Blackberry Glazed Pork Chop with Blackberry Demi Glace. Served with Creamy Parmesan Polenta and Roasted Cauliflower Moutarde, it was insanely delicious. Thick and juicy, the smokey flavor of the pork blended magically with the blackberry demi glace. Fantastico!

For dessert I had their Sweetened Ricotta, Pistachio, Shaved Chocolate and Whipped Cream. Truly an orgasmic combination in a dish, it was an incredible blend of flavors. The nuttiness of the pistachio paired so well with the sweet Ricotta and I savored each and every bite. This dessert was nice and light and was the perfect conclusion to my memorable evening.

This place is amazing and I can't wait to go back!",1,"good"
"3","Reservations Gourmet- to-Go is often overlooked at as a Seminole Heights eatery but shouldn't be. Reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook. The kicker is, that if you have been to Reservations you'll crave it even when you have time to cook.  Reservations serves quality home cooked meals to-go and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious.

Not only is Reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated. The owners Anthony and Elke live here in Seminole Heights and make everything from scratch.

One order will usually serve a two people.  We have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers.  The order pictured to left included:

Yankee Pot Roast, fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots, onions, green beans and potatoes for $11.95

Chicken Rustica,  boneless breast sautéed with crushed red pepper, garlic, capers, olives, tomato and Romano for $11.95

The Yankee Pot Roast was good but the Chicken Rustica was fantastic (BTW I am a fan of olives) . The mashed potatoes are great and the salad's are above average. Other hits include the Chicken Marsala and the Meatloaf. Reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the Polenta Lasagna; polenta layered with portobellos, parmesan, mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.

Reservation's specials change weekly. Make sure you sign up for their e-mail list which is on a clipboard on the front counter.

There is seating at Reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich.  The hot sandwiches are a must try. Topping the hot sandwich list are the Hot Meatloaf Hoagie and the Buffalo Chicken Finger Sub for $7.95 each.

If you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you $4.50. The Cheese Cake is a hit among neighbors but I have to give my personal recommendation to the Carrot Cake. I am not a fan of carrot cake but the Reservations version kicks ass.",2,"good"
