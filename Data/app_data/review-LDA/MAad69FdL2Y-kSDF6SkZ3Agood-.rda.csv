"2","Whoa, 5 stars! Are the sushi rolls as good as Kanno or Sake Don? Well, no, probably not, but I am giving this restaurant five stars for a few reasons. The concept, the convenience, and the price. It's conveniently located right by clearview mall, so it's in a perfect location for a lunch or dinner before the movies or before a shopping trip. It's kind of like a sushi version of Pei Wei. You order up front and the food is brought to your table. The prices are great especially for the amount of food you get. The lunch bento box really caught my attention because you get a choice for each component. I chose the hot and sour soup, fried rice, spring rolls, crunchy roll, and chicken teriyaki. My boyfriend chose the salad and the cream puffs for his so that we could share and try everything. I really liked the cream puffs, but I liked the sauce that the spring rolls came with. I love that I was able to get a crunchy roll rather than a california roll which is what most bento boxes come with. The chicken was good, and it was quite a filling/enjoyable meal for $10.00.",1,"good"
"3","I had a sudden crave for Sushi last night and passed by this brand new restaurant last night, my wife and daughter wanted to give them a try, and glad we did.

My daughter ordered a California roll from kids menu, and it came out with a very cute 2 components bento box which had cali roll and fries, my daughter chose an organic milk with her meal and total was only $6. 

My wife and I ordered a bento box, hot and sour soup was delivered to our table right after we sat down. Soup was very tasteful, chicken teriyaki in the box was perfectly cooked, it was tender and there was a baby bok-choy vegetable underneath the meat and it was yummy with the sauce. There were two pieces of vege spring rolls came with the box, extremely fresh, vegetables inside was crunchy and had lots of flavors. The portion of the bento box was so big that my wife ahd to ask me to share with her. 

I ordered couple of special rolls because I noticed the price is fairly cheap like only $11, for most of sushi restaurants probably will charge $13-$14. Pop this roll is a cooked roll, I also ordered Ocean waves which has raw tuna and salmon on top. I got my rolls less than 10 minutes with the bento box, we were kinda surprised by how fast they make sushi. The presentation of the roll was great, rice melted in my mouth and they were full of flavors with the sauces, the raw fish was extremely fresh, I have to say they are definitely one of the best sushi i ever had. 

We couldn't finish the food we ordered cause the portion was too big, my wife packed the rest to take them home. Overall,  it's a cool place with very relaxing atmosphere, price is cheap but doesn't compromise the quality. Food comes out really quick which is perfect for people who want good sushi but hate to wait. I absolutely recommend this new restaurant and definitely will go back soon!",2,"good"
