"2","The ambiance is easily 5-star material, with an upscale sophisticated decor, relatively dark with attractive lights and candles on the tables. Great look for a romantic dinner.

The Tom Yum Soup (with chicken) is exceptional, and is the primary reason my wife would love to take me here often. We've been known to get two or three orders of the Tom Yum soup to-go, so she can enjoy it for a few days after our visit. The Miso Soup is also very, very good, with lots of flavor.

The sushi is excellent as well. My wife loves the Sunset Roll, and I'm partial to the more complex rolls with a variety of flavors and textures. These include the Gulch Roll, the TNT Roll, the Predator Roll, and the Titan Roll.

The only thing I've been disappointed with at The Eastern Peak are the main dishes that we've tried. The Pad Thai doesn't have a lot of flavor, and I had the same experience with the Drunken Noodles. Considering that the soups and sushi are so good, I've been really surprised that we haven't found a main course that we've found to be up to par.

If you are in the mood for sushi and maybe some soup, with a wonderful and romantic atmosphere, The Eastern Peak is a great choice.",1,"good"
"3","Just had the most wonderful dinner here. We made a last minute reservation on a Thursday night, and were seated immediately upon arrival. We were greeted warmly and took in the incredible interior. The restaurant itself is stunning. Very modern, but still warm and inviting. I don't say this lightly either, because Nashville has some beautiful places to eat. We have dined many times at the eastern peak on Thompson, and actually had no idea that the menu was not the same. We were excited to try new dishes though, and love dining a bit more upscale than usual. Clayton was out server, and also who I had spoken on the phone with when I made my reservation. He was so incredibly charming and kind. He was training a new server as well, and was polite to introduce her and let us know. The menu itself is well sized and easy to read. As for the price, it is easily a place where it's 25-40$ a person, but you're dining in the gulch, not ""east nasty."" We ordered the edamame, a bottle of sparkling sake, and a craft cocktail. The cocktail was their spin on a rum runner and SO GOOD. Sake was 21$ for the bottle, but 2 servings and delicious. The edamame was spicy and cooked to perfection. I caught myself eating it so quickly because it was that good! As for the entrees, we got two rolls, two sides, and an entree. The menu has so many choices, and is laid out with starters, salads, noodles/rice, chef specialities and then lots of rolls/sashimi/nigiri. I see some people complaining about how there aren't many sushi choices, yet I noticed dozens of options. Maybe try a cheaper sushi place? Like the ones with a train or at Kroger???? Anyway, the rolls were rather large and so delicious. Ingredients were fresh and cool. I had the veggie roll which was the BEST veggie roll I've had in Nashville. Already planning on coming back for it. My boyfriend had the titan and loved it. It was massive. The garlic bockchoy was really yummy and the crispy garlic was the perfect touch. Their miso soup packed a punch and we fought over who finished it. The main dish was the crab spaetzle. My boyfriend said it was probably the best pasta dish he's had. He couldn't stop himself and finished the whole thing! In my opinion, I'd get a group of people together and share a bunch of things. The portions are definitely shareable and there's so many options! Overall the menu is very thoughtful and well designed. Definitely going to be a top contender for hot spots once the word gets out they're open! We will be back soon to see Clayton and enjoy another incredible meal! Thank you for an awesome date night! (Also the bathrooms are so gorgeous. Who doesn't love a nice bathroom????)",2,"good"
"4","I ordered the seared duck breast which was DELICIOUS and the Brussel sprouts were phenomenal. The food was absolutely wonderful but due to the atmosphere... I don't think we will be back. 

That said, it took over 45 minutes to be given our entrees after ordering and while our server apologized, we weren't offered a discount or an apology from management. Our server was very polite and accommodating but what concerned me most was the ambience. 

When I was there over the weekend, I overheard the manager, David yelling at employees and I couldn't make out what he was saying but it was so loud and aggressive it made me incredibly uncomfortable to be in an environment where the management is coming across as emotionally abusive to employees. It made my friends and I really uncomfortable and the servers seemed visibly shaken if not upset. I asked a woman who said her name was Jessica who was yelling and she told me it was a man named David who happened to be the manager. She said that he is always like that and that she wishes she could change it but has no control over anything or he will fire her. She seemed visibly uncomfortable and I felt SO badly that she seemed stuck in such a toxic situation!

It made everyone at the tables around us so uncomfortable several people made rather audible comments...frankly I won't be back until there is new management. I can't imagine working somewhere where your manager screams at you at an audible level that patrons can hear it-- it seemed like a toxic work environment and made it very hard to enjoy the meal.",1,"bad"
"5","I hadn't heard much about this place, but we still decided to try it out. We went in at about 6:30 on a Sunday and there were only 2 other tables in the place.

Aesthetically... it seemed to have good bones.  The back area is especially nice. The metal screens are great, but the lighting fixtures, curtains and techno music felt a bit out of the early 2000s.  The servers uniforms were also a bit dated.  I wish they were wearing black or something rather than a Cheesecake Factory looking uniform. 

Service... our server was great.  I wish more of our experience was with her. However, the bartender ""didn't see"" our ticket so drinks took 30min to get to the table.  The manager came to talk with us at one point and he wasn't very professional.  When food was cold he tried to spin it as our preference and blamed us rather than simply being apologetic and fixing it.... Also they have trays and tray stands everywhere, which a bit cluttered and dated... Oh and they were taking photos of the food for marketing, but why would you do that during a dinner ""rush""? There was just a flash that went off in the background constantly.

Drinks - cocktails were really good and they had a decent selection of beer too. A little pricey, but no big complaints. 

Food... For our app we had lettuce wraps. They had really good flavor, but we figured out you had to dig down deep because the sauce (where all the flavor was) was all at the bottom.  We also had the drunken noodles. They were good. No complaints. Then we had the Bork belly rice dish.  The rice wasn't even warm and the pork belly was slimy and improperly cooked. They took it back to correct, but the pork was still bad on return

All in all... they have a lot of little things to fix here and there.  I think everything can be fixed and the place has great potential. We will have to wait and see if they'll actually make the needed changes.",2,"bad"
