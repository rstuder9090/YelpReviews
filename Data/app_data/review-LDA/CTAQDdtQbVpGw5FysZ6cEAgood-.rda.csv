In addition to a great lunch deal, I was happy to have some time away from work sitting at the sushi bar watching the ships on the river.

They have delicious fresh sushi, great lunch specials, a nice, friendly sushi chef behind the counter. ( I overheard him talking to several folks who came in to order 'to-go' and he offered to deliver their sushi to them at their jobs. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I don't think they offer delivery regularly.) It is a tiny space with only a few chairs at the sushi bar, but plenty of seating in the food court.

While I reviewed the menu options a small dish of noodle salad was placed in front of me. It was light and tasty, topped with a pinch of seaweed salad. I ended up ordering the Roll Lunch Special. For $8.50 you get to choose two styles from a short list of sushi rolls and it is served with a cup of miso soup, too! Soup, salad and two sushi rolls for under $10!! I will NEVER get grocery store sushi again!!",1,"good"
"3","Is it strange to give a solid five to a place in a mall? Perhaps, yet Jazz Sushi earns every star. There wasn't a thing to dislike, except, perhaps, for its out-of-the-way location (top of the stairs, to the right, and through the food court) which makes it rather difficult to find if you're following a GPS. 

They offer some nifty lunch combos, which are served all day apparently. I tried the roll special--choice of two full sushi rolls plus miso soup, and, with Yelp check in, a free and seriously delicious cold noodle salad with a pleasant sesame flavor. 

I asked for spicy sauce and crunch on my rolls, and was obliged at no extra charge. My meal cost only $9, and there was enough to take home.

The folks on staff were friendly and accommodating, and chatted with me while I ate at the bar. 

It seems they also deliver, which I'll be sure to take advantage of in the future.",2,"good"
