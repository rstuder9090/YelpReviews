"2","Adding to my review now that I've ventured passed the sushi into the dinner hibachi. 

Service was excellent and fast. Our teppanyaki chef was very entertaining, which is 60% the reason you go to these time of places. The other 40% is to enjoy watching delicious food in front of you, and as well as the yum yum sauce :). The team service we had kept food and drinks moving and seems we were starting to eat in record time. The food prepared was delicious and cooked to perfection. Overall had a very enjoyable time between food, speed, quality, and service. 

Now I have reasons to go back here for lunch and dinner. Definitely a top spot in our new local places to frequent",1,"good"
"3","Everything is indescribably delicious! But I'll try! The vast space is decorated Japanese-style with dim lighting and friendly, prompt service. Pretty little Japanese dolls are perched beautifully at the foyer entrance, along with the Lucky Cat, who is waving ""hi"" to you ;). Seating inside is a large sushi bar, pub tables, hibachi and regular tables, as well as a few booths running along the outskirts of the restaurant. Cozy.

I'm in this restaurant a lot! You could say I can't live without this one, and this sushi is always in my regular rotation. The rolls here are always made with very fresh fish/seafood and all the accompanying ingredients of fruits and vegetables are super-fresh as well. 

I've tried quite a few rolls, and so far, my favorite on the menu under 'Chef's Special Roll', is a fancy roll at $15, called ""The Lobster Dynamite Roll"" - with each piece having a nice big chunk of lobster, it is wrapped in seaweed with a piece of mango, avocado, sushi rice, then covered with spicy tuna, and drizzled with sweet chili sauce to top it all off. Delicious! Akira's rolls are comprised of 8 pieces, and range in price from $4.95 to $18.00 for special rolls.

Lunch Specials are always a good way to go. Hibachi Meals come with Onion Soup, Hibachi Vegetables, and Fried Rice. Starting at $9.95 with either Chicken or Vegetable, a lunch with Filet Mignon as your protein is $13.95, and a 'Combination' of two items (Scallops, Salmon, Shrimp, NY Strip), can range in price up to $15.95. Bento Box Specials can be had for about $10, and will include Miso Soup or Salad with Ginger Dressing, White Rice (Fried Rice is $1.50 extra), and a choice of California Roll or Spicy Crab Roll. Two really good lunch deals! Akira also will will pack it to-go for you on some of the lunch specials (obviously not the Hibachi).

The cooked Dinner/Ala Carte/Appetizer items are very good also. I've tried the Crab Rangoon, filled with sweetened cream cheese. The Katsu Chicken is always excellent; with crunchy and lean white-meat chicken, it is always fried in fresh oil. Chicken Teriyaki and a number of similar proteins are offered ala carte. Sashimi, Yakitori, and even Fried Oysters are just some of the appetizers to get you started on a great meal journey.

If there is any complaint, it's a very minor one. That is, for to-go rolls, Akira should package the rolls with high-domed lids. This is because with some of the larger rolls, it sometimes becomes necessary to have to scrape part of the toppings off the lid. I was going to dock a star for the price point being a little bit high. However, I'm not going to, because the fresh ingredients, the friendly staff, and the clean and spotless space of this restaurant make their food well worth the money. 

I highly recommend Akira Hibachi and Sushi Bar! 

Don't be late!

FIVE FABULOUS STARS!!!!!",2,"good"
"4","If I could give them a negative 5 I would. I got the lunch bento box Katsu chicken w/ the spicy crab roll. The chicken tasted like seafood. NO BUENO. The chicken was dry they put no sauces in the bag. I also got the mixed greens salad. I'm not sure why it is called mixed greens when it's literally ice burg lettuce with a few strands/chunks of carrot. The dressing they gave had an odd taste. I have eaten at many other places before and never  have I had such a nasty ""dressing"". I order gyoza as well and it was another disappointment they were soggy. At least they didn't leave out the sauce but it was honestly disgusting the sauce made it worse. The soup was literally brown water . Horrible experience all around. To pay a little over $20 and get food that isn't even edible is ridiculous. For a place to be known for sushi and not even the sushi was good is a problem. There was not one thing I ordered that I ate. Annoyed isn't the word and I hate to waste food but I chucked it alll in the trash !!!!! Because that's exactly what it was garbage  just gross!!  people done waste your money!! DONT GO HERE !!!",1,"bad"
"5","Shockingly bad experience.  1st the service was pitiful as neither one of the staff wanted to take the order.  Then we had to sit for 10 minutes watching our order on the bar.  Ok, that stuff happens.  Let's get the food.  My wife and I are experienced sushi lovers and well traveled.  I have had some of the best in LA, Seattle, and Dallas.  
The miso tasted burnt.  How do you burn miso...?
The order was a standard ca roll, spicy tuna, spicy salmon.  The basics people.
The tuna was in a paste form with filler added.  I don't mean fine mashed with a spoon.  I know that proper technique.  I mean paste.  We could not tell the difference between the tuna and the salmon.  The ca roll was not as bad but I have had better premade at a grocery store.
Needless to say we left 80% on the plate, stood at the register waiting to pay.  Why did I pay?!?
Our search for sushi in Florida continues...",2,"bad"
