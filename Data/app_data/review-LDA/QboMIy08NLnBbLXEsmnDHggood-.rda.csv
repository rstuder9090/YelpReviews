"2","What an amazing experience! I don't think I have anything negative to say about it. It was my first experience with Izakaya style food. I've had Spanish Tapas before in Barcelona, but never had Japanese Tapas. It was a real treat! I'm still thinking about all the yummy things that we ordered for lunch. The menu is full of appetizers, small plates, sushi, sashimi, ramen & udon, rice, grilled fish, meats, and veggies. You can even have a low carb feast here as they have so many skewer options. They have all kinds of unique snacks. Things that I would only imagine seeing in places like NYC. It really does have that whole Japanese pub feel about it. Very comfortable and unpretentious. The service from Joy and other staff there made it even better. Joy had awesome recommendations for us starting with the spicy octopus cups and the strawberry nigori sake. Her description of it sounded perfect and she was right on target. Definitely get the Homare strawberry nigori if you like that hint of sake mixed with a strawberry smoothie taste and feel. I shared the bottle because it would have been too much alcohol for me (yeah I'm a lightweight), and my friend also loved it too. They offered to give us 2 sake glasses without even asking. Great service!!

Anyway, it was so difficult to decide. The menu is extensive and there are just so many things that I wanted to try. I ended up getting the spicy octopus cup. It was exactly what I wanted. I normally get the scallop but the octopus was perfect. I also got the fried oysters after others raved about it in the reviews. They were so right. The oyster tasted so light and fresh. The panko coating was super light and crispy. I was also blown away by the eel skewer. The eel was so tasty and meaty. I'm used to having very thin slices on top of a sushi roll. This eel was thicker and had some fat on it. I loved the sweet eel sauce coating as well. You will want another skewer so you may want to order 2 of them.

I did get the tonkotsu ramen lunch special that comes with a salad. I probably didn't need it but I couldn't pass it up. The ginger dressing was very good, and the salad was cool and fresh. The ramen was excellent overall. I know some places have a better presentation, but not all of them have a perfectly marinated egg. This egg was delicious! The yolk had that custard consistency and that salty umami taste was present as well. That's what really made the ramen stand out to me. Oh and that huge slice of braised pork belly was seriously calling my name. It was a fattier piece of pork belly than I'm used to. I won't lie, there were times I was just chewing on fat but it really was full of flavor. The broth was your average tonkotsu broth that I love. I've only had it at 4 other restaurants. I can say that the broth on this day wasn't as salty as others I've had in the area. I tasted more of the pork which I'm happy with. I only wish that it had black garlic oil added to it. That would have put it over the top for me. The noodle to broth ratio was good. In fact, I didn't eat all of the noodles because I had to try my friend's appetizers. Yes, that was my excuse for not eating all of it.

I sampled the Lollipop Roll which is your typical Naruto roll, but it was presented beautifully with lollipop sticks. The Passionate Salmon Roll was excellent. I love salmon but never thought to pair it with passion fruit pulp. It was very refreshing and light. Oh, and I sampled the bacon wrapped scallop. That was also good as well. It was all perfect including the atmosphere. Just a chill and relaxing place where you can unwind during lunch or at the end of the day. I got NYC vibes there, but that may be just because I saw a couple of people wearing Yankees caps and the d√©cor on the walls and the bar area reminded me of the city that doesn't sleep. 

So, parking is kind of weird. There isn't much of it around. It's really typical of South Tampa restaurants not to have a lot of space for that. They do have a parking area around back which is for all the businesses in that plaza. I haven't been there during peak times but I was able to find a spot around back. I can't wait to go back and try the Shiso Rangoon, Seafood Ceviche, and Garlic Butter Bok Choy. I had such a wonderful lunch experience!",1,"good"

For an appetizer, we got the lotus root chips with ponzu Guacamole. The guacamole could have used a bit more spice and flavor but was not too bad. The lotus root chips had a unique flavor. 7/10 

The Mexican Sushi roll came with tempura shrimp, avocado, spicy mayo & smelt roe and was pretty tasty. 8/10

The Futomaki sushi roll consisted of shrimp tempura, cream cheese, jalapeno, avacado, tobiko, scallion, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. 9/10 

All the sushi was fresh and tasty. Service was quick and friendly. The decor of the restaurant looked festive with lots of Japanese writing everywhere, exposed brick walls, and sumarai armor on display. The Music playing was mostly light contemporary pop and was not traditional Japanese music like most of other sushi restaurants. I look forward to coming back soon to try more off the menu!",2,"good"
