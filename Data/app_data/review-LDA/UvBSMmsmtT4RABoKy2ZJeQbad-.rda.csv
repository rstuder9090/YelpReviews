"2","I've had a lot of great burgers in Nashville, and this ranks high among them. I ordered the jalapeño burger and was not disappointed. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. The beef was fresh, juicy and well-seasoned. If I'm not mistaking, it tasted as if the buns were slightly buttered on the inside (?). Either way, they were amazing. As per the jalapeño, the spice level was mild, so it didn't overpower the burger at all.

My husband and I also ordered the hot chicken spring rolls, which were a nice (and tasty) nod to Nashville. The chicken inside the roll had a traditional hot chicken flavor and a very nice mayo dip to cool the spice. We will definitely be ordering these again.

I'm far more a fan of burgers than sushi, so I'm happy to have a place where friends can get their sushi fix and I'm not annoyed to tag along. 

Our server was speedy and pleasant, and I loved the decor and overall vibe. Can't wait to come back and try more! Next up: the Truck Stop and a spiked shake.",1,"good"
"3","I had very high expectations for Lucky Belly, as I'm a big fan of Two Ten Jack. I was quite entertained by the confusion I overheard from some college kids discussing the menu, ""It's japanese....burgers?"" 

The decor is super trendy, complete with servers in flannel shirts , faux graffiti, and a fireplace painted to look like a giant happy robot. The menu is, of all things, entertaining. Ever wanted to play Russian roulette with your sushi? Now you can.  They have a Dare Devil roll, in which ONE random piece is loaded with Habanero Bullseye sauce. 

My tuna burger was topped with pickled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and... Wasabi mayo. I got the mayo on the side because I don't handle spicy very well, but trust me when I say it's not hot at all, just delightful. I'm not big on fries, but the fries here are actually fantastic. The meal was wonderful. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with a jalapeño aioli and she really enjoyed her meal too and said she will be bringing more friends back soon. 

I also grabbed a side of eel nigiri because I wanted to try the sushi. Unfortunately, the sushi didn't quite measure up for me. The eel was just a little rubbery and dry and really light on the sauce. It's the only reason this isn't a five star review. 

Some might find the menu of Japanese inspired burgers, sushi, and spiked milkshakes confusing, but I personally found it delightful and am glad to have found this place!",2,"good"
"4","Lucky Belly was a place that I used to tell people had the best burgers.  I went today and it was not a good experience.  Maybe the chef changed, but I ordered a burger that was supposed to have two thin beef patties (kind of like a glorified Big Mac).  The burger came out with two, THICK, mini burgers.  I'm talking patties that would be considered a lot of meat on sliders.  It made the sandwich extremely difficult to eat so I just gave up.  I asked the waitress if they were supposed to be thin, and she said yes, and that she had told the new cook they needed to be thinner after serving mine. (Why wouldn't she have taken it back immediately and have them remake it correctly before it was served is beyond me).  It was very clear that I was not pleased with the meal, and nothing was offered as a considerate, act of customer service.  My friends burger also had a mustard on her burger which was a totally different mustard than what was explained on the menu.  Like I said, we've been there multiple times before, but this place has just gone down hill.  I am a server/bartender and understand how important a pleasant experience is, which this was not.  Both girls working on the floor were on their cell phones and we had to wait longer than we should have to check out (we were the only ones in the restaurant).  Sorry Lucky Belly, you've lost two customers.",1,"bad"
"5","Stick to the burgers and appetizers, the Sushi is the same Zumi sushi with less flair, the sushi rice was just plain white rice nothing else, I can tell you the fish isn't fresh, but freshly frozen like most folks in town.  The hot fish sandwich, I wouldn't get again, it just a mediocre fish sandwich between a few pieces of white bread and a bunch of chili paste, Dijon and pickles, it needs work and isn't creative at all.  I tried the LB burger my family member ordered and it was on point. I'm usually not a fries guy and all mine where gone, so good.  Service wasn't bad price points were decent, waiter forgot our sushi roll and I wish I didn't say anything because we could've went without it, the menu descriptions need a little work. All in all I wish the concept of the menu was better, but we can't win them all...",2,"bad"
