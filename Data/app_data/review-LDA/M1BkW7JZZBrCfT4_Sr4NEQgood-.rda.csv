"2","I had a sushi burrito and I loved it! I was a little nervous. Would the seaweed wrap be chewy? Would it stay together? Would the flavors work? The sushi burrito anxiety was real and it took me awhile to try it. If you feel like this, don't worry. It is not that scary. 

The Spot is combined with Ha Long Bay. You can actually order Pho with your sushi burrito! Anyway, if you walk into ""The Spot"" side of the restaurant, you will see that you order your burrito like you would a certain fast food Mexican burrito.

First you pick burrito, bowl or salad. Then you pick your protein. You can pick two or three for a higher price. Then you pick sauce, veggies, and toppings. Then you watch your beauty be wrapped into a burrito. 

I ordered a burrito with salmon and tempura shrimp (I highly recommend both). I then asked about the sauce and was recommended the spicy sauce since I am a heat fiend. I added cucumber, carrots, and jalapenos. I then added sesame seeds and little crunch wontons for texture. 

Some of the things that you could also add that I remember were tuna, corn, cilantro, red onion, avocado (upcharge), asparagus (upcharge). There were a lot of other choices too, but that is what I can recall.  

I grabbed a drink, a container of soy and lots of napkins (note: grab extra! Burritos are a little messy if you are like me and dip in soy).

The first bite was magical. It was super fresh, delicious, salty and crunchy all at once. Each subsequent bite just reinforced my joy. I polished it off and left very happy. I will definitely return soon. It is a little pricey, but I think that it is worth it. You have to try a sushi burrito if you are a sushi fan. You will love it!",1,"good"

My sister calls sushi burritos, burrushi. I don't know if this is an L.A. hipster label or if that is its formal name. Either way, it is now stuck in my mind so I'm going to try to make it a thing, because it's so fetch (anyone get the Mean Girls quote?).  

Burrushi is huge in California, but it is only now beginning to gain popularity in the Tampa Bay area. I wouldn't say that Largo is a huge trendsetter, but it may be trying to prove me wrong. I often scoff at restaurants that are an odd combination of different ethnic foods (I just saw a restaurant that touted Thai, Chinese, and Greek food - uuuhhhh), but here I relish the fact that they have burrushi and Vietnamese. My husband would never agree to eat burrushi, but he loves a good banh mi! This means both of us are happy - it's a win win!

There are two doors, one for the burrushi side and one for the Vietnamese side. You can order burrushi on the Vietnamese side. For those of you who run cold, like I do, bring a sweater. Even if it is blistering hot outside, it is pretty cold inside. This makes sense, because you want to keep your fresh fish cold, but my fingers were blue by the time we left. The restaurant is clean and had cheery accents of bright green. This is a great restaurant for a date!

I got the Original Sushi Burrito with Spicy Mayo. I wasn't adventurous enough to make my own burrushi yet. After eating my burrushi, I now question why I would even want to mess with perfection. It is divine. It was the perfect amount of fish, vegetables, and rice all wrapped in soy paper. It came with three shrimp chips. I know, three sounds stingy, but they are large shrimp chips and the star of the show is definitely the burrushi. I was afraid it wouldn't fill me up, but I was wrong. It is the perfect lunch portion.

Of course, I had to try my husband's food as well. He got the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich, without mayo, pate, or jalapenos and the appetizer of fried chicken. Both were good. I'm used to my banh mi bread being toasted, so the lack of crispiness threw me off a little, but it was still a solid sandwich. I always love the way Asians fry their chicken. I think it is something about the coating that I really enjoy. I would recommend both of them, but not above the burrushi.

Come and try the burrushi. You will become a fan.",2,"good"
