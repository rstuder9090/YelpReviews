"2","I really, REALLY like this place. I have been here a number of times over the last two years thanks to my friend, and fellow AYCE sushi warror Kristina. This place is never SUPER busy(although I do come on off times), which is nice. The bar is a bit small but I never sit at the bar at this place because I prefer to do some serious damage at a table where they can bring out trays and trays of sushi for me. The area is light and comfortable, and I can actually see my food unlike some other weird, dark sushi places. 

Service is pretty good, though admittedly, they do mix up my orders sometimes. I ordered one order of mussels last time and somehow ended up with four. I`m not really complaining, but it was just random and odd. On other occasions I`ve gotten rolls that were meant for other tables which is again not a huge deal. I`m very non picky and forgiving in terms of mistakes. I think it adds to the charm and overall experience. The servers are always really nice, attentive, and willing to accomodate your requests. The price for this AYCE sushi establishment is on par, if not a little bit lower than others in the area. Lunch is a great deal with AYCE appetizers, a good selection of rolls, nirgiri, and dessert. I`ve never been here for dinner but I`m sure it is just as good. You get free sushi on your birthday, and they have a VIP card. Take note. 

As far as the quality and taste of the sushi I have to say I really enjoy Sushi Rose. I think their nirigi is put together well with not too much rice and a nice sized slab of fish on top. It tastes fresh, and the texture is buttery and definitely a turn on. :) They have some pretty standard rolls here that you are likely to see around the Reno AYCE Sushi scene. Golden Gate, Reno, Spicy Tuna, Mountain, etc. I think the rolls are executed well with an abundance of fish and filling added. The rolls topped with crab are overflowing with delicious shredded crab. The quail egg shooters are yummy! The appetizers are really awesome. I usually get the tempura vegetables, seaweed salad, miso soup, mussels, and crab rangoon. All really yummy. I like the texture of the mussels ALOT(which is why I didn`t mind the four orders). All in all I really like this place. Small, cute, good service, good sushi. Go!",1,"good"
"3","Still one of my favorite sushi spots. Mariner is amazing cooked roll along with crazy hand roll. The sizes are so perfect to not get full on one long roll. 

There are mainly 3 servers it seems, two males, the blonde one being newer than the dark haired one, Riley. The woman is efficient and wants to provide you with good service but she can leave fast and doesn't always smile, but she isn't rude. 

I think the chef Chao is gone, haven't seen him last 3 times I've been in, which have been different days. The lady chef is still there along with a young white male and another couple Asian makes. I haven't sat at the bar in a long time so I have no idea who is making what, but I've been pretty happy with everything the last 10 or so visits. 

Today on Mother's Day they were slammed and short staffed a bit. The chefs accidentally made us our 5 long rolls order twice (they must have forgot to mark off they were already made, or make that a policy lol) but when we brought it up the Asian woman server, she misunderstood us thinking we were complaining about wait time when really we weren't prepared for another 3 long rolls that was a double order. Riley ended up taking our plate away without hesitation after we brought up our issue with him and he understood our concern about not being able to finish those extra rolls. I didn't watch what he did with te plate, but I sure hope they sneak in the back and get to eat the mistakes cause I felt terrible for the waste, but it wasn't our fault. Next someone who was helping the chefs, I think he's from the wok side, brought us over 2 more rolls (the chaos) we had already had and we had to say again, we already got them. He came back with the ticket and we cleared up that that the chefs made the orders twice, again no issues. 

I still love the mussels, some say overdone but I love them crunchy and drier, also never had a beard left on here which ruins me for mussels for months. Skeeves me out when they aren't cleaned right. 

The miso is some of the best in town too. One time a guy came in with a big thermos and asked for that and a big styrofoam container to go haha

This time I also had some of their appetizer tempera calamari which is now added on to my regular stuff to order. Served with just teriyaki sauce I loved the flavor. Not rubbery and not heavily fried. 

Edamame is solid as well as the seaweed salad which is just sold/bought in a premade container anyways. 

The quail egg shooters are good too, made with soy which I like. 

Size and rice to fish ratio is the same and perfect for AYCE. The rice is still some of the best flavored in town IMO. 

I'd say the biggest downfall might be chef creativity as far as different things not on the menu, and no Wayne's rolls here. Which reminds me the cooked scallop mixture is not good here, very bland and you can tell its mayo mixed in. The scallop nigiri (hotate? Something like this) is amazing here with the delicious ponzu sauce, too bad I can't get them anymore.",2,"good"
"4","It agonizes me to write this as I'm still in pain from the awful experience I had at sushi rose. I feel I should begin by saying that this is not the first time I ate here, it was the second... and last. The first time there were only a few customers so I got my sushi in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, speed does not cure mediocrity. 
I began my evening by swinging by sushi pier II.  I ate there a couple of weeks ago and was pleased with the service but even more with the quality. It's too bad I was looking to do a carry out order and this place was way too busy.
I figured sushi roses sub par product would have to do as it is on the way home and shouldn't be as crowded. I walked in to a semi-crowd, but nothing to warrant walking away. I decided to eat in and did all-you-can-eat. I first ordered two hamachi and two albacore nigiri. After ten minutes they gave me octopus, which I return promptly... No big deal, I'm not in a hurry, mistakes happen. After waiting another 7 minutes I get my albacore. While waiting another 5 minutes to be asked if I would like more to eat, I hear the table behind me complaining about how many items they have been brought that they did not order... They would like their food, the right food.
The evening continues... More people leave and more people arrive, more orders are screwed up and more minutes pass between opportunities to request food... If I could just get what I ordered ten minutes ago. 
At least the waitress is kind, and expresses her regret and frustration with the chefs. Enough to earn her a tip, hopefully they let her keep it. 
At the end I place a takeout order for my fianc√© who is vegan and texted requesting two avocado and asparagus rolls. $15. I asked them why and they said ""asparagus""... There's an item on their menu that includes avocado/asparagus/unagi/crystal shrimp and some other fish with sauce for 9.50... But I get charged 7.50 for two vegetables because apparently asparagus is a delicacy. She did not reduce the price but did throw in a super special seaweed salad. Thanks but that's not cutting it at this point. 

In summary, this is the first bad review I have ever written. I feel it was my obligation to report this crummy experience. If sushi rose gives a hoot about their customers they will take this is as notice to do better... They have lost me as a customer because I'm not willing to deal with it in hopes that they will get it right this time. Try it yourself if you'd like... Maybe steer clear of Friday night and don't expect proper cuts, quality rice or simple designs. Try getting some of their rolls in your mouth without spilling, near impossible.",1,"bad"
"5","YAWN! What a boring place. I made a special trip here due to a glowing review in a newspaper. Gonna have to write that reviewer and tell them ""get thee to a real sushi place"" because this place was so mediocre I'm having trouble not falling asleep remembering my lunch so I can review it. It was such a snoozefest I didn't even bother taking any photos. Which for me is a huge deal. But there was nothing worth snapping at all. Boo!

I went at 2pm for a very late lunch because I picked up a friend from the airport; there was only myself, my friend, and one other person in the place, and there were 3 sushi chefs (two of whom were women, which is kinda cool) yet it took us 15 minutes to get our first order, and more than 15 minutes to get each consecutive order after that. I was there so long just trying to get a few rolls that I was mistakenly charged the dinner price of $19 when I was ready to  leave instead of $14 for lunch. 

My stars are low on this place for so many reasons, the first of which is how wretched it is when, to a person, every employee ignores you unless you force attention out of them. And then when you do get them to pay attention to you, they just stare at you, slack jawed, and basically say and do nothing. I hate that!

Second, the rolls are completely unremarkable except for one fact - they all seem drenched in a dark, extremely bitter sauce that just ruins the flavor of the rest of the roll. Even scraping the sauce off, I didn't like the flavor of any of the rolls - just too  boring. All the rolls tasted exactly the same. Most had nothing other than that bitter sauce done to them to make them interesting. Even the muscles came out as 3 little PLAIN warm mussels - nothing on them at all! I've never seen that before in a sushi place ever. Normally there's sauce or juice or something. Nope, not here. Jut plain boring mussels. Weird. 

Also, everything is served in miniature - the rolls are tiny to begin with, but then they're cut into even tinier pieces, and the nigiri is so small it looks like a teeny doll-sized portion. Which wouldn't normally matter except it takes FOREVER to get an order out of these people, so you can eat your ""roll"" in about 2 bites, then you have to wait and wait and wait for two more bites. Frustrating. 

I agree with the Japanese reviewer who said while the fish isn't so bad that it's going to make you sick, it's just not very fresh. It was rather mealy and had no flavor. The tobiko was especially old, being very fishy and chewy instead of brightly popping. I was also shocked when I ordered the crab roll appetizer - it was not the typical deep fried roll, it was just a few premade Chinese crab rangoons with absolutely no filling. As lunch progressed, I dared ask a couple of questions and when I finally did get a response, it was a shrug with the answer ""we get everything premade from The Company"", whatever that means. I'll tell you what it meant to me - they don't do anything original or house made here. Boo!

Third, the music is horrible. On this day, a very short, very small looping tracking of techno pop stuff was playing that was irritating mainly because every song repeated over and over because we had to sit there so long waiting for food. 

At first I added a star because they do have different free ""all you can drink"" beer and free saki on different days, which is cool ... IF YOU CAN GET IT OUT OF THEM that is. I was brought a free drink, and was told it was ""all you can drink free"" so I ordered just one more... and never got it after asking for it multiple times. So bye bye additional star. 

I strongly disagree with that glowing newspaper review and instead agree with Yelp reviewers who say they're not coming back here - I, too, will go back to my favorite sushi haunts, never to darken the door of this place again. If I feel the urge to take a nap over my lunch, I'd rather do it at home, it's cheaper.",2,"bad"
