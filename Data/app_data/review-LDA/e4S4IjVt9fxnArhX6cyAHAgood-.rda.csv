"2","The ambiance is easily 5-star material, with an upscale sophisticated decor, relatively dark with attractive lights and candles on the tables. Great look for a romantic dinner.

The Tom Yum Soup (with chicken) is exceptional, and is the primary reason my wife would love to take me here often. We've been known to get two or three orders of the Tom Yum soup to-go, so she can enjoy it for a few days after our visit. The Miso Soup is also very, very good, with lots of flavor.

The sushi is excellent as well. My wife loves the Sunset Roll, and I'm partial to the more complex rolls with a variety of flavors and textures. These include the Gulch Roll, the TNT Roll, the Predator Roll, and the Titan Roll.

The only thing I've been disappointed with at The Eastern Peak are the main dishes that we've tried. The Pad Thai doesn't have a lot of flavor, and I had the same experience with the Drunken Noodles. Considering that the soups and sushi are so good, I've been really surprised that we haven't found a main course that we've found to be up to par.

If you are in the mood for sushi and maybe some soup, with a wonderful and romantic atmosphere, The Eastern Peak is a great choice.",1,"good"
"3","Just had the most wonderful dinner here. We made a last minute reservation on a Thursday night, and were seated immediately upon arrival. We were greeted warmly and took in the incredible interior. The restaurant itself is stunning. Very modern, but still warm and inviting. I don't say this lightly either, because Nashville has some beautiful places to eat. We have dined many times at the eastern peak on Thompson, and actually had no idea that the menu was not the same. We were excited to try new dishes though, and love dining a bit more upscale than usual. Clayton was out server, and also who I had spoken on the phone with when I made my reservation. He was so incredibly charming and kind. He was training a new server as well, and was polite to introduce her and let us know. The menu itself is well sized and easy to read. As for the price, it is easily a place where it's 25-40$ a person, but you're dining in the gulch, not ""east nasty."" We ordered the edamame, a bottle of sparkling sake, and a craft cocktail. The cocktail was their spin on a rum runner and SO GOOD. Sake was 21$ for the bottle, but 2 servings and delicious. The edamame was spicy and cooked to perfection. I caught myself eating it so quickly because it was that good! As for the entrees, we got two rolls, two sides, and an entree. The menu has so many choices, and is laid out with starters, salads, noodles/rice, chef specialities and then lots of rolls/sashimi/nigiri. I see some people complaining about how there aren't many sushi choices, yet I noticed dozens of options. Maybe try a cheaper sushi place? Like the ones with a train or at Kroger???? Anyway, the rolls were rather large and so delicious. Ingredients were fresh and cool. I had the veggie roll which was the BEST veggie roll I've had in Nashville. Already planning on coming back for it. My boyfriend had the titan and loved it. It was massive. The garlic bockchoy was really yummy and the crispy garlic was the perfect touch. Their miso soup packed a punch and we fought over who finished it. The main dish was the crab spaetzle. My boyfriend said it was probably the best pasta dish he's had. He couldn't stop himself and finished the whole thing! In my opinion, I'd get a group of people together and share a bunch of things. The portions are definitely shareable and there's so many options! Overall the menu is very thoughtful and well designed. Definitely going to be a top contender for hot spots once the word gets out they're open! We will be back soon to see Clayton and enjoy another incredible meal! Thank you for an awesome date night! (Also the bathrooms are so gorgeous. Who doesn't love a nice bathroom????)",2,"good"
