"2","I feel like I should always preface my reviews for Japanese restaurants with a disclaimer - I work in quality control for a living, and I used to live in Japan, so bear that in mind when you read my reviews for these kinds of restaurants, LOL!

Wasabi is really not bad at all. Although they have effed up my to-go order every. single. time.... but I can't complain b/c the 'mess-ups' were delicious ones, so it wasn't a big deal or anything. 

Tried their chirashi. It was tasty but seems really overpriced considering the amount you get. It kinda pales in comparison to Fin's but Fin is much farther away, so I am willing to pay the extra amount...I just imagine it as the equivalent to what I'd pay in gasoline driving to some other restaurant where the chirashi is slightly cheaper and you get more for your money. At least, though, they will sub out any squid/octopus (I have issues with the texture of those) with masago/ikura for no extra charge. I wish the chirashi came with nori furikake though! And extra pickled ginger and other pickled stuff. Mmm that would be so good. I am getting hungry just typing this, bahaha!

They had uni last time I was in but I was too nervous to try it, worried it wouldn't be good. Uni can be kinda hit or miss, even at places where I have had top notch uni before. Plus the value of Uni from Bob's Seafood is unbeatable!! *Uni Lust!!*

I love their green tea here and I love how it is served. Hard to explain, you just have to see it in action!!

My companion typically gets their chicken teriyaki dinner. I tried some. It wasn't bad but hella sugary, and the rice tasted like it had a gallon of butter dropped on it. Not my thang. But he seemed to enjoy it! 

Their maki rolls are pretty good too although, again, hella dolllaaaz. I think I am becoming a cheapass as I get older, LOL. I like to get some every once in a while, but I could not afford to eat here weekly. Perhaps I should try their happy hour as I have heard good things about it and it  seems more affordable that way. I am dying to try the fried lobster roll. Mmmm!!! I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they have soba noodles here, served COLD as they should be (in my book anyway.) I also like that they have all the right toppings. Shit, I think I may need to go call in an order of soba noodles now, agghhhh! Don't Yelp on an empty stomach, peoples!!

The staff here are really nice and I've had pleasant exchanges both on the phone ordering to-go and also in person. I've only been in once to sit and eat dinner, but it was a good experience. I just wish their property management/building company/whatever would allow them to install some kind of a antechamber type of thing in the front b/c when it's 7 degrees outside and you are seated at the front of the restaurant, and another customer opens the door to come inside, a BLAST of icy air shoots in and it can be overwhelmingly chilly for a bit before the cold dissipates. Had even asked them about it and they said they weren't allowed to do that b/c the building company said it would be ""aesthetically unpleasing."" Lol wow. Well good thing it's not winter year-round here, or that would be a serious cockblock when trying to enjoy one's dinner. 

Also apparently Yelp will deliver food from this place (""EAT24 App"") to your house, but I think there is a fee of $7? Or maybe it was $10? I forget!! But that's an option now, apparently. Also according to the manager's comment below, GrubGo.com will deliver for a minimum fee of $3 (it goes up based on how far away you live from the restaurant.) But there is a minimum order of $15, just as an FYI.",1,"good"
"3","I eat at the Town & Country Wasabi very regularly. I was out in St. Charles on a Tuesday running a work errand and decided to give this Beale Street location a try since was dinner time and I was hungry and right there. I walked in and asked for a table for 1. This really perplexed the hostess. She made me wait about 5 minutes for a table even though there were roughly 9 empty tables. If you've been here you know this is a smallish place and they probably only have about 20 tables total so they were half empty. She was mentioning to someone else that one of the tables had a reservation over an hour away. I'm a single diner. I'm going to eat and leave...not linger. After I finally got sat the service from my waitress was lovely and the food was great just like the Town & Country location. I ordered one Clayton Roll (Crunch mix and cucumber topped with seared tuna, fajita pepper, and eel sauce), one Spicy Omega Roll (Spicy salmon and shrimp tempura, topped with tuna, avocado, and sweet chili sauce), and one Playboy Roll (Spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, topped with salmon, avocado, and wasabi trio sauce.) I managed to finish :-).  The hostess needs a lesson in being a hostess. It gives someone a first impression and my first impression was not favorable. Turns out everything else made up for it.",2,"good"
