"2","Probably my favorite sushi spots in all of Bloomingdale. 
They do 50% off rolls all day every day and even their speciality rolls are decent priced ($10-$13). If you do delivery of $30+, they throw in a free Yummy roll ($7 value) which is actually one of my favorite rolls there anyway. Also really like the Koo roll, the Dynamite roll, and the Long Island roll. 
I got green tea fried ice cream from here once- nothing crazy, I had better. 
For being in the middle of a huge shopping plaza, the indoor atmosphere is shockingly nice compared to the looks from the outside. Very friendly servers but they do get busy often and if you do delivery- expect it to be a while",1,"good"
"3","I've been to Osaka Sushi a number of times. They have great lunch specials, and it's very affordable. What I didn't know is that they also deliver to your home. I believe the only times they don't deliver are between the hours of 3 pm and 5 pm, but you can always call the restaurant just to be sure. I had delivery for lunch the other day. It was super quick. I couldn't believe how fast it was. As others have mentioned, even the baked sushi rolls were still warm. Just for that, they get an extra star. I don't know of any other sushi restaurant that delivers in this area. That's what makes this place unique above all the others.

I had the Typhoon Roll which consists of spicy salmon and avocado that is topped with mango. Inside the ring of the roll is a mixture of baked crabmeat & fried scallops in some kind of spicy sauce and other toppings. It was so yummy! I also had the Nicole's Roll which appears to be a more healthier option. It had lots of crunchy veggies (shredded cucumber and avocado) along with the crabmeat salad inside the roll. It was topped with eel, tuna, salmon, white tuna. It was very much like a Rainbow Roll but had more of a crunch because of the veggies. I'd definitely order both of these rolls again.

It's an easy place to miss. It's located in the Winn Dixie shopping plaza off Bloomingdale and John Moore, and it's not visible from Bloomingdale. There have been 2 other different Asian restaurants in that space over the past 10 years. I've liked all of them. They have lots of specials (lunch & happy hour) which is another reason why it's so popular with the locals. I don't go there as often as I should because there are so many other good sushi places around us. It just all depends on what I'm in the mood for. Each one has their own specialty.",2,"good"
