"2","I've never gotten sick from eating at Rusan's, so I can't relate to a lot of the other reviewers.

That being said, I LOVE Rusan's! It is by far THE hippest/swankiest sushi joint in Nashville - I would definitely take out of town friends here on a weekend night to give them a good impression of Nashville.  However, there is always a long wait, and you can't really do much in the vicinity while you're waiting.  It's definitely a hole in the wall, which can be great, but waiting in your car in the gravel parking lot for 1.5 hours since there's nothing else close to it COULD be a little more exciting.  

Now, on to the food...

Everything is reasonably priced, but the atmosphere is 1/2 of the experience.  Yes, it's true that you may not be able to hear anybody in your party talking on a Fri. or Sat. night, but who cares?!  You're here to gawk at the gorgeous 20-somethings that flood the place around 8-9 pm, not to have an intimate conversation.  The staff puts on a ridiculous show whenever somebody does sake bombing, and if it's somebody's birthday, well, i won't ruin the surprise...ok actually I will: my friend's birthday there resulted in both of us being forced to dance on top of our table w/ a complete stranger while being served a jazzed up twinkie for dessert.  TWINKIES AT A SUSHI RESTAURANT?!?!

Their menu is laughably long, with everything from cilantro-flavored 'tiger beef' to innovative rolls like the cranberry roll and a million others I can't remember.  I once accidentally ordered completely raw beef, and the waiter took it back and gave me something else with no complaints.  Last time I was there you could get a discount on the lunch buffet if you went after they stopped making fresh rolls.

Overall, I think Rusan's is the perfect prelude to a concert/night on the town.  The food is good enough in itself, but the trendy atmosphere and beautiful patrons make the potentially long wait worthwhile.",1,"good"
"3","RuSan's offers adequate food with reasonable prices. I have been there twice in the past three years and found the food & service to be consistent each time. The buffet is filling with an assortment of fried & seafood sushi rolls, noodles, fried rice, calamari, four other selected dishes of the day, Vegetarian Inaka Miso Udon soup, salad, & lightly fried banana rolls. If you do not care for the buffet there is an extensive menu of your favorite Japanese cuisine(s).

Very Important Tip #1: Please note to NOT waste food from the buffet or you will be charged for what you do not eat. There is a sign posted on the buffet & the server was kind enough to inform us as well. 

Tip #2: The weekday Buffet is best to get there before 1:00 pm. 

Tip #3: The parking meters in front of RuSan only allows 1 hour intervals for a maximum amount of $1.00. Bottom line save your change as the meter will only count up to $1.00 & anything more it will just take it. 

Now to the physical condition of the restaurant. The restaurant is as clean as it gets as I witnessed them disinfecting, sweeping, & mopping. However in all honesty this restaurant could use a makeover/renovation/upgrade. The plates and silverware are scratched, the floor is scuffed, the green tea kettle appeared dingy, the female restroom has two stalls with one missing a door, and the buffet equipment is worn & outdated. 

Take some comfort that RuSan's has a 97 health rating as of September 2015 that is visible in the front of the restaurant. 

The ambience, decor, cleanliness, quality of the food, & service are very important to me and that can make or break my overall dining experience. They did change their music (thank goodness) to more pop & classic rock genres. 

Four generous stars as this restaurant has the potential of being a five restaurant however; needs major improvements in the areas mentioned above sooner than later.",2,"good"
"4","Stopped in yesterday for lunch. Very busy at 1:00; I grabbed a seat at the bar, but wasn't there for the lunch buffet, though apparently most everyone else was. There appeared to be 2 servers and one host available for the entire restaurant, which was quite crowded, but not to capacity. I started with a spinach appetizer while I took my time to peruse the menu. When the server finally returned, I asked for an order of Toro and an order of Uni; she'd told me she'd have to see if they had any. She returned quickly, only to to advise no, they had neither. She said they were ""seasonal."" OK, then maybe that could be noted on the menu??? I didn't care for the spinach appetizer; the long thick stems were attached (big ones, we're not talking baby spinach) and I could handle that, but didn't at all care for the sickly sweet sauce that was pared with it. I was expecting more of a peanut sauce, shame on me for not knowing the difference. I are less than half of the spinach go-ame appetizer.   Perusing the menu was a chore, since MANY of the rolls are either deep fried or contain fried items. I typically don't like anything in my rolls to be fried, so at least half the the menu items would be off the list. 

I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll next. There were three pieces of nigiri tuna within the roll, with a splat of very tasty spicy sauce on top. Also included was a slice of avocado and some cucumber. Sadly, the rice was not evenly distributed on the nori, so literally the bottom 1 & 1/2 "" of the cone were empty -  just the nori. Most times when I've had spicy tuna the tuna is chopped and mixed with the sauce, but not always. Served this way, it was much harder to evenly distribute the spicy sauce to all the bites. Some were very spicy, some not at all. I unwrapped the roll to try and re-distribute the rice and sauce and was a little more successful, but feel it's a shame I should have to do this with a $5 hand roll. Really? You can't even put the rice to the bottom of the nori??  

I then ordered,against my typical preference,  a roll with tempura shrimp & avocado. It was tasty, but the pieces were very very large. I ate half of that, as I mentioned that fried anything in rolls really isn't my style. Finally,  finished with a sunset something-or-other roll. That one was the best, fresh salmon and tuna in very nice portions inside, and the finished that happily. 

The server was adequate, given how many patrons she had to cater to, though my water was completely empty and I had to flag her down for a refill. However, when seated at the sushi bar, I was forced to look at the dirty restaurant equipment, with the back stainless wall caked in splattered grease. The health food score in front showed the restaurant received a respectable 89, but I cannot see how based on what I saw yesterday. The floors are worn, servers overworked, and menu advertises items they do not carry. I've been to more than 30 sushi restaurants in and around Nashville and the immediate area. There are many restaurants less busy, with much better food and much more reasonable prices than Ru-San.   You won't catch me at this one again. Sad if this is all the Gulch has to offer!",1,"bad"
"5","I think I only need to say this: I've thrown up on THREE separate occasions after eating the sushi at Ru San's. I'm to blame for going back after the first time. 

However, I'd like to describe an altercation I had with one of the owners when I simply wanted him to take a single item off our ticket that was not prepared correctly and because our fish was old and rubbery.

My girlfriend and I ordered dinner: 2 sushi entrees and a handful of a la cart items. She'd ordered the ""Godzilla Roll"" - something that I had ordered every time I'd dinned here, probably totaling 15 visits over 2 years. My favorite roll, it's comprised of red snapper and macadamia nuts rolled in rice, flash fried and covered w/ a spicy aioli, then baked. I was very familiar with the food's preparation and character. 

My g'friend consumed ONE piece of the 5 presented on the plate, followed by some of the a la cart items. She put the 2nd roll into her mouth and started chewing, but abruptly spit it out into her napkin. The fish was rubbery, like calamari. She asked me to check it out. One look at the dish and I could tell it hadn't been prepared correctly. No flash frying and no baking - therefore not prepared as advertised, and the raw fish was old and chewy. All in all, she ate one piece, spit the other in her napkin and I sample 1/2 of a 3rd.  That's 2 1/2 pieces of the 5 on the plate (this comes into play in a second). The saba nigiri (salmon) was also not at all fresh - she had to pick it up with her hand and stretch and pull on it to rip it with her teeth. 

Being very disappointed in the dish, I notified the server that we would like to request that he take that single item off our ticket ($8.95). He refused, saying that if we ate more than 1/2 of the dish that they do not offer refunds. After an exchange with him, I asked to see the manager on duty who in this case happened to be a part owner of the restaurant. He was very rude and matter of fact in pointing out that, clearly marked on their menus, is a return policy stating that if you ate more than half your dish, you could not get a refund. 

To avoid a heated exchange, I paid for the item. After paying, I checked the menu for the refund policy. Nowhere on the menus is this information he quoted printed - as a matter of fact, refunds are ONLY available for food that is NOT PREPARED CORRECTLY. Also, we touched exactly 1/2 and not more (if we want to go with a technicality).

Upon leaving, I approached the owner and took issue with his claimed refund policy on the menu. I asked him why he lied to me - He replied with ""We give NO refunds, no matter WHAT,"" thus contradicting even what WAS printed on their menu. 

Later that evening my girlfriend got sick from the food she ate. 

I ended up contesting the charge w/ American Express and had our total ticket refunded to me ($70)

In a nutshell - rotten food, rotten people, rotten restaurant.",2,"bad"
