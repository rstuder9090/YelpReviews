"2","I was not sure about this place but my friend wanted to go. 
Disclaimer, I do not eat sushi - they always forget to cook it. (humor for anyone who has forgotten what that is). 
Seriously, I do not eat sushi so I am not reviewing the sushi. 
When I walked in I thought the place was a bit weird, it did not have any booths and it was quiet. 
The place was spotless, I love clean places. I am seeing more and more unclean restaurants lately. 
They were incredibly polite and patient. 
Most of the dishes were in Korean, or maybe Thai, actually not sure which language but not English. I did not know what the words meant, so my server explained the meaning of a few words. The fact that he explained five or six words made the experience so much better. 
I do not know how to explain this but the staff was ""present."" They did not seem to have anything on their minds but ""being there"" to help you. It was very nice. 
I ordered the shrimp tempura starter and a chicken dish with ""Amazing sauce.""
My friend ordered a tofu soup and a tofu dish. 
The tempura came with a sweet chili sauce that we both loved. 
I did not try her soup but she said it was very good. 
I loved my Chicken with Amazing Sauce. It was a peanut sauce of some kind but better than most peanut sauces I have had in the past. 
One thing to note, they only lightly cook their vegetables, they are very crunchy, if you are an older girl like me and want your vegetable more cooked, you need to request that. 
The portions were a nice size, I was satisfied. 
It is not only important how a meal tastes but how it makes you feel later on. 
I felt great after I ate this meal. Those healthy vegetables hit the spot. 
I want to add this to my list of favorites.

"3","5 of us including 2 kids arrived about 6:00 on a Saturday. The main parking lot was already full but plenty of parking on other side. However, some of those must have been employee's cars as there weren't quite that many diners inside. The decor is welcoming, very nice, looks and feels Thai. 5 stars for Thai ambiance. We were seated right away and several other groups came in as we looked over the menus. We had printed out some coupons from their website but forgot them at home. I pulled up the coupon on my phone and before we ordered anything we explained we had forgot the hard copies. The waitress said we could not use that, they had to be printed out. It's 2015, imo, showing your phone should be acceptable now. Also, NO kids menu which is very disappointing so plan on spending adult prices for your kids meals. 5 Thai teas, Crab Rangoon and Spring Rolls to start. Thai tea is so good and addicting as it should be. Rangoon was made with curry powder which I hadn't had before, it was different, and good. The (2) Spring Rolls were standard fare. Being our first visit there, and one of our groups 1st Thai experience ever, we both ordered Pad Thai. I know it's Thai version 1.0 but I like it. Their Pad Thai comes with 2 shrimp and chicken. It was quite good. I would say that the sauce however did not have quite as much flavor as others I've had. I've seen this before with Pad Thai, it seems the lighter the color, the less flavor. It's not a spice/heat issue either so maybe it's the ratio of fish sauce or tamarind? It was still good and I would get it again. My newbie decided to kick it up a notch with the spice tray and she liked it. The wife got the Amazing, a peanut sauce dish which was quite different than the ""Amazing"" she gets at our usual Thai place. Not what she expected, she really liked it and would get it again. It was quite spicy though which was not indicated as such on the menu. One of the kids ordered their usual sushi rolls which they said were really good, but not quite as good as they had at Jimmy's last week. The other ordered the Broccoli entree with Chicken. That dish was made with Royal Oyster sauce and we asked for it on the side, we also asked to substitute baby corn for carrots, all of which came out as requested. The broccoli was cooked perfectly with good flavor, and the kid even dipped the chicken in the oyster sauce which was also very good. I would totally order that dish for myself next time. Being a party of 5 they automatically add 18% gratuity to the check which totaled $106. That may sound expensive but we didnt order any expensive dishes. It adds up though, Thai teas are $3.00 each, we ordered 2 appetizers, and 2 sushi rolls, and one kid who we can normally feed for $5-6 had to order an $11 adult meal. Overall the atmosphere, food and portions were very good, the service was decent, and it was a nice dining experience. We will go back. 4 stars is my highest rating for a restaurant like this as I reserve my 5th star for rare incredible experiences and/or very high end establishments.",2,"good"
"4","If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. First of all, as a local I've eaten here in the past and it's nothing to rave about. I've had way more authentic, more flavorful Thai food. However it is the best Thai establishment within a delivering location. Upon my order I was advised it would take an hour for delivery. Being a Saturday night I chalked that up to them being busy. After an hour and 40 minutes I called them to see what was taking so long. They blamed it on traffic.... I live 3 miles away so I didn't buy it but they promised to deliver with a free appetizer next order. After 2 hours it breached unacceptable boundaries. I called back to complain and coincidentally the driver pulled up while I was on the phone. Not only did he not give the order for free at that point, he pulled off after claiming they were busy. Now may I tell you they advised me they had 2 orders ahead of me when I ordered. 2 hours is not acceptable to deliver cold food much less take that cold food away after pulling up in front of my house. I will never try to order from this lazy, mediocre  establishment again. In two hours I could have learned to make red curry myself!!!!! Shame on them. DONT EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",1,"bad"
"5","We have been here several times because it is less than 10 minuets from home and each time the food has been great, but tonight was anything but up to par. We ordered two pad Thai combo dinners which came with shrimp and chicken. We ordered the dinners to go and once we opened the dinners and emptied them onto a plate and picked through it and eating it we noticed the dinner was lacking chicken and shrimp. We were given two small shrimp and three pieces of chicken in each dish for a total of $27.00!!! I would say two popcorn shrimp and three pieces of chicken and the rest being all noodles for $27.00 is a lot of money. In my opinion when you state on your menu that a meal comes with shrimp and chicken you expect more than two pieces of shrimp and three pieces of chicken. I have never in my life of ordering out or trying different restaurants have I even been given such a small amount of meat. 

I mean yes I love carbs, but I also love meat/protein! 

I decided to call the restaurant to see why there was a lack of meat compared to our previous orders. All the lady could say is that the OWNER prepared the food and she weighed the chicken to make sure it was enough. I told her other establishments provide plenty of meat with their dishes. I asked what could be done to rectify the situation and the girl put me on hold AGAIN to talk to the OWNER who did not want to speak to me. All the owner said that she would do is refund my money if the food had not been picked through or eaten. Well Owner of Thai Coconut how am I not supposed to inspect my food without picking through it and eating a few bites from a to go order and when the container is a extra small aluminum container?!? 

I am not one to complain, but when I am paying x amount of money for food that has always been good in the past and now it is lack luster I will say something. And then on top of it when the owner could not take the time to speak to a customer who has an issue with the way they prepared the food which I find disrespectful to someone that is helping to keep you in business. 

So to say the least I will not eat here again and drive the 20 minuets to Thai Bay and Thai Basil.",2,"bad"
