"2","We went there during our travel to Tucson. It was after a day of intensive hiking, so we decide to try this buffet. I would say that the buffet is worth the price. There are a lot of choices for people with different preference. The food is yummy and I love their mushrooms.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I are traveling in AZ. We both like buffet and planning to travel this restaurant. When I first came inside, the area is clean and tide. There are several kinds of food which always hot and full. I love sushi and their sushi are really good. The salmon and avocados are fresh and the soups are tasty. The price is affordable. The waitresses are nice and talks our plates away fast and always come to refill our drinks. We would come again if we get another chances.",2,"good"

This is my first review and its bad. I mean I usually don't write reviews cause I don't care that much but the toilet did it for me. Don't come. These guys are so damn cheap they won't even buy a new plunger which, by the way the left outside. No but seriously the plunger is a broken stick with duct tape. The food wasn't any better then the craper, it was old, soggy, and greasy. The waiters are total dicks and don't care about you. The owners seem to hay anyone. Including little kids  they have posters everywhere that say limit what you eat on an all you can eat buffet and kids under 10 need an adult to go to get food. The toilet paper hurt and I stood in line to crap for like 20 minutes cause they only have one stall that was old and broken down. GOD DANMIT THIS PLACE SUCKED",1,"bad"
"5","We will looking forward to having a good dinner and we came in with a smile but the receptionist/cashier in that restaurant ( medium sized Asian guy wearing glasses) was not NICE. He was VERY RUDE and was rushing things not even welcoming us and no greeting at all. He was acting like he doesn't like customers.  What? He's supposed to be the one that you see first and should give PAYING customers the respect they deserve. . That kind of work ethic will ruin the reputation of a restaurant. He just want to play with his phone and sit there like he doesn't care. When he give us table, the chairs were ripped and the carpet is dirty. You can't even chose a table because that's where he wants us to sit. Are we in Communist country or what? ....to sum it up.. The food is okay and the servers are okay but that guy ruined our beautiful evening. Management should do something about that. We didn't get his name cause he didn't wear a name tag..",2,"bad"
