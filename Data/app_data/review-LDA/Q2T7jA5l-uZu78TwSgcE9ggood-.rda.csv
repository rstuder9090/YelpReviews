"2","Sushi burritos, poke bowls, and sushi rolls OH MY! I really enjoyed my experience here at Zukku despite my inability to try most of the delightful menu items (#pregnancyissues)! 

The ordering process was easy, they have a new set up where they have laminated menus available on a stand/easel type thing in the area where the line forms and you mark your orders with a Vis a Vis marker. The intake person/ cashier at the monitor was pleasant and entered my order efficiently. The other staff on board were also cordial and helpful despite being busy. 

I ordered a little bowl with a melange of different vegetables and substituted brown rice for the white that is standard. I was happy to see that shiitake mushrooms were available as an add on (for an additional $1). The mushrooms in my bowl were delicious as were the other vegetables, I felt they were cooked perfectly! I liked the medley of fresh ingredients together. 

All of the orders of the group I was with came up fast-I was impressed! There is a station for soy sauce and chopsticks off to the left once you pick up your order. My friends had the sushi burritos and raved about them. They also mentioned the filling:rice ratio was adequate. I look forward to trying one on a subsequent visit. 

As some other reviewers mentioned, I did feel the price point is a bit higher than one might expect but they are a new business with fresh ingredients and there is overhead people! Overall I was very pleased with my purchase. This vendor, as with many at HPM, only accepts credit or debit cards.",1,"good"
"3","Growing up in Los Angeles, sushi and poke were always staples in my diet. The make your own poke bowls are delicious and a great way to satisfy your sushi/poke craving. 

Pros: it's located in armature works so if other members of your party aren't the biggest fans of raw fish or sushi, they can choose other dining options and you can eat together. If you choose your own bowl, you can choose 3 embellishments ( my go to date edamame beans, cucumber, roasted corn, and seaweed salad (worth the extra .50 cents!) and unlimited things to ""finish it up"" so lots of picked peppers, red onions, togarashi (spicy seasoning so good!) scallions cilantro tempura chips and others. Probably the biggest pro is that the fish is so FRESH. What keeps me coming back to this place. Free parking in large lots, if you wait around for a couple minutes you'll easily find a spot

Cons: it's armature works so if you go at a busy time, practically always, it can be hard to find a place for your party to sit and enjoy your meal together. Sushi and poke is expensive, as expected but that's what you get for quality fish. I personally always go with the big poke bowl so you can choose two different proteins (my go to's are salmon and tuna) 

Overall, this place is worth the price. Have yet to try their rolls but their poke bowls are wonderful",2,"good"
