"2","We have avoided this place like the plague because people said it was bad.  Well they were all wrong, it was great.  We went in on Saturday for dinner because it was on the way home.  There is nothing special about the décor, but you cant eat that so I don't care.  The first pleasant surprise was the one man band in the corner.  I know what you are thinking loud and obnoxious (I was thinking the same thing) but it was a young girl that sang very soothing music that fit the mood my family was looking for.  The second surprise is an kids menu that fits the generic American child's food pallet, both my kids got chicken nuggets.  

FOOD:
Crab Salad - Going into to this I thought it would be like Wasabi's crab salad, but I was wrong again.  It was a sweet vinegar dressing that was very refreshing.  It was a great way to cleans and prep the pallet before the other items.
Crab Rangoon's - Some of the best in town.  They were very light and fluffy and filled with crab.  You heard me correctly it was filled with crab!  It was probably around that 40% crab instead of your usual 5-10% crab.  My daughter even loved them because they had an actual crab flavor.
Sushi - Sunburn Roll - This is a simple and inexpensive roll with lots of flavor.   It is a California roll with spicy sauce on top and backed under the broiler I think.  It had a slightly smocked flavor that was enjoyable.
Sushi - Nitro - This is a big roll so you better have a big mouth.  It is a spicy tuna roll topped with avocado, tuna, crab, crunch, bonito, shredded nori & spicy mayo.  This roll was refreshing and surprisingly light.  The waitress suggested both rolls and she was right on the money.

So if you are looking for a new sushi place over by the lake you should try this place, we will be going back.",1,"good"
"3","My buddy lives near Geist and we both love sushi.. With that being said, I am very picky about where I go to eat it. We meet for lunch about once month at our norm, One World Market near castleton which I think is the best!! We decided to try something nearby and consulted yelp. Red Sake Asian Fusion popped up only 2 minutes away. Wow, I'm impressed! Nice quaint little restaurant tucked away in a little strip mall... Lunch special!! Take a look at the picture, this is what you get for around $60 at lunchtime... Simple sushi that is made fresh. Can't beat it!! They do have nigiri, sashimi, etc... Awesome!! Now we don't have to fight the traffic and hassle of the castleton area !!",2,"good"
"4","Went last night and it looked like high schoolers all work here. First I have to say that I think the restaurant is confused b
About if it is Chinese or Japanese food. Aside from the small portions the Chinese food is definitely better than than Japanese food. What are lo mein and general Tso's chicken and then I ordered five kinds of nigiri sushi, one hand roll and one Maki roll. I was the only one who likes raw fish and eats sushi at least once a week on a regular basis. I ordered snapper, yellowtail, masago and a salmon skin hand roll. They admitted that they have never done a salmon skin hand roll which is a little unusual because every train sushi chef has learned to make this before they're allowed to make sushi on their own. That is if they are properly trained which my guess is that was the reason. I can tell this because I'm the sushi skin hand roll they left salmon me which turns to salmon jerky under the broiler where all you want is the crispy salmon skin. So it tasted overly fishy because of the meat of the fish being left on the skin. I did not eat yellowtail or the snapper because I took one bite from yellowtail and I could not bite a tough tendon or other connective tissue like silver skin that was left on it. I also tried the Yellow Tail and that did not seem fresh as the Flesh of the fish when you touch it seem to just much apart which is usually the sign of old fish so I would not eat it. For this reason you would think the wait staff would ask me is there a problem because I pretty much left everything on the plate but all they did was ask if I wanted to box and I said no. I was waiting for them to say was everything okay. Which, by the way, never happened. Now on to the Chinese food that's in my family at ordered the lo mein was not made with lo mein noodles it was made with something like a spaghetti noodle and the general Tso's chicken came out with a pile of rice on the same plate with the General Tso chicken was actually the most surprising as it was a small what would be the equivalent of a lunch size portion in a Chinese restaurant. It was plated with the rice on one side of the plate and the chicken on the other. Being that it was such a small portion I am very surprised that it was $15 that's overpriced for a dinner portion in a Chinese restaurant let alone a lunch size portion which should have been about $6.95. This meal should not have been more than $9.95. We lived nearby and I passed this place quite a bit so my sister suggested we eat there. Me I don't think I would go back. Her comment was she had been here before but it was seem to be different back then.",1,"bad"
"5","If I could give zero stars, I would. We'd gone out for a short date night and thought we'd try this place, hoping for a place to make our nearby go-to. The service was really really slow, and the teenagers, while lovely, just weren't particularly in any hurry to help. We ordered, most of the beers were out of stock, but got some Kirin and Sapporo. The appetizer jalapeño surprise was middling, the jalapeños were undercooked by a lot, but a decent heat to them and ok blend of flavors. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, for the sushi combo and the pho. Finally it came. Please see the pic below. I know I've been spoiled by twin cities pho, but I've never seen or tasted anything like this. It was at least day old meat, Pearly sheen and rubbery, had been cooked for hours in the broth, which tasted rancid. The noodles were basically vermicelli, and there was about an entire pound in there with maybe 5 pieces of rotten meat. the accompanying basil was old well-past-gone basil (not Thai basil), ponzu with no selections of other sauces or chilis, jalapeños cut In giant chunks, and the world's oldest, saddest, HOT and wilty bean sprouts. 

I would say that you shouldn't offer pho if you can't even make a close approximation of it, but serving old meat in basically hot water (no way that was bone broth), with a pound of spaghetti and a smattering of old sad side items makes this downright offensive, even from a service standpoint. A server shouldn't want to serve that. I sent it back, which is a huge deal and I've never had to do it before for pho.

My husbands sushi was middling, the salmon was not fresh and definitely slimey. I'm so sad that this was our experience, it would have been nice to have a neighborhood go-to, but this was downright disgusting.",2,"bad"
