"2","I went here on a Friday night and I was surprised it wasn't packed.  We walked in and got a table right away (they also have plenty of seating at the sushi bar).  The server came to our table with warm towels for our hands, which I love.

Before ordering we asked our server a few questions about the menu and he was unable to answer them.  I don't know if he was new or the servers are just not knowledgeable about their menu.  He was nice though and turned to the chef behind the sushi bar and she was really helpful.  We started with the wasabi honey shrimp.  If you go here I suggest getting it!  The shrimp was delicious and the little crunchy balls of wasabi completed the dish.  We ordered the rainbow sushi roll, charlie brown sushi roll and the sushi box. All the fish was fresh and the rolls were perfectly made and tasty.  It was reasonably priced for sushi, with 2 glasses of wine we spent $70.  This has to be one of the better sushi places I have tried.

Overall, the place was clean, food was great and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I am giving this place a 4 though because the wait staff  could use some training.",1,"good"
"3","I had just taken a horrible sociological theory essay exam and my hand felt like it was going to fall off. I also felt like I had given birth, the test was that intense so I decided to try Wasabi Lakeview on my way home from school. 

I live in a condo on Lake Marina Drive so I can practically walk to the restaurant but I didn't. I drove. So sue me. 

My dinner was delicious. I started with the squid salad (perfect)  I had two of the rolls they had on special (from what I gather they are permanent specials) the Metairie roll and the Fuji Roll. I also had fresh salmon and eel sushi. The Sushi was so fresh and yummy. But the rolls were outstanding. 

The Metairie roll is tuna, snowcrab, avocado wrapped in white rice and drizzled with the eel sauce. But the Fuji Roll was out of this world. Inside the roll was tempura shrimp, cream cheese, snowcrab, wrapped in rice paper and then topped with shredded crab stick and crunchy. The roll was then topped with a delicious spicy mayo. 

The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out at lightening speed. (there was only one other table in there). I highly recommend this place. I've been to the one downtown several times and love it as well. I can't wait to eat at the Lakeview location again! (Sorry Hana).",2,"good"
