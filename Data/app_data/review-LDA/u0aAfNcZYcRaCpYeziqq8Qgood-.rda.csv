"2","Celebrating our anniversary we decided to do Asian cuisine and after reading reviews for various restaurants in the area we decided on Poseidon. All in, it was a good experience. Upon entering, we were created with a warm welcome, They truly make you feel they're thankful you came in. As it was a Monday night we didn't make reservations and were seated immediately. We  brought wine to enjoy with dinner as well. After reviewing the menu and deciding what we wanted we were ready to order. Our server was new but was on top of everything. When we go to a restaurant of this caliber ( opposed to a high end steak seafood rest. )  we usually order our apps before we place our dinner orders because we don't want to be rushed. But, as we placed our order I asked our server to make sure they don't rush and bring everything out at once and she seemed to understand. I ordered Tuna Tataki, Hot and Sour soup and LaLa Chicken as my entrée. My wife ordered Pork Dumplings and Sesame Chicken. My soup and her dumplings were brought out soon after, however within a minute or two, my Tuna was brought out, so much for not rushing!. My soup was hot and flavorful, My wife enjoyed her dumplings. The tuna was cold, good presentation and good flavor. While we were eating our apps, a manager stopped by to check on us. We asked him to make sure they don't rush the entrees and he definitely understood our request, however, as soon as our apps dishes were picked up when we were done, our entrees arrived. Again so much for not rushing!.
My wife really liked her Sesame Chicken and my LaLa Chicken was very good as well. My only complaint would be that the LaLa Chicken was described as very spicy on the menu and I was looking forward to it. Although it was cooked with dried red chilies and fresh jalapenos, it wasn't very spicy. I asked for some chili oil and paste that helped increase the spice level, however as the dish had good flavor, I wish I didn't have to add anything to make it truly very spicy. The portion sizes was good and priced fairly. I would say my Tuna was a little more pricy for the portion size, but it was very good. All in we enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service, but next time we return we'll definitely take our time ordering and then perhaps I could give 5 stars.",1,"good"

I started off with their green tea and an egg drop soup. The egg drop soup was perfect for this chilly weather but also a great hearty belly warming starter dish. I ordered their General Tso's Tofu as the main dish with white rice and my fiancé ordered Kung Pao Chicken. Both were delicious especially the crispy tofu. It was cooked just right and plenty of spicy chili sauce on the dish. The first time I have been here was over the summer and had the sushi lunch special. Highly recommend it is a great price! Also, got the scallion pancakes and they were perfect.",2,"good"
