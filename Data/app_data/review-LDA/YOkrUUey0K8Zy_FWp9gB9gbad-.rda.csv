"2","I love Asahi Sushi. I should preface this review by stating that if it involves mayo, a fryer, or fruit; I can promise you I'm not interested. I don't eat fancy rolls. Fancy sushi for me, is a unique fish that I haven't had before. 

Asahi's fish is fresh. As a result, the flavor is full and rich and the texture is perfect. Their house salad isn't the best that I've ever had. Their seaweed salad is good as well. I also really enjoy their vegetable tempura and the Japanese pickles.  

If you are a nigiri sushi fanatic, ask the sushi chef what he recommends. The other night he suggested monkfish liver. It was really good. He's also got my boyfriend and I hooked on this amazing tuna and bonita. One of the rolls that we do enjoy here is the salmon skin roll. Crunchy and delicious. 

No one eats here. I don't know why. As a result, the service has always been really great! I don't think that they are slower than any other sushi restaurant. 

My ONLY problem with Asahi is that they are located in Belle Meade and it's a small hike for us to get over there. It's probably for the best. If they were closer, I'd probably turn into a piece of sushi because I'd eat here everyday.",1,"good"
"3","I feel the need to write this review to counter all of the bad reviews! My husband and I have been eating at Asahi since it resided on the corner of Harding Pike and Harding Place. I do miss the hole in the wall location a bit but the newer location is more spacious. Luke and his wife are lovely people and we like supporting a locally owned family business. 

When reading the bad reviews I kept thinking people are confusing Asahi with a different Japanese restaurant because we've never encountered the problems others are describing. First and foremost, the sushi is always fresh! In all the years eating there we've never had any fish that seemed even slightly ""off"" as one person described. While we order rolls we mostly choose Nigiri where it's imperative it is fresh because you can't camouflage the taste with the ingredients you might find in a roll. We eat Salmon, Tuna, Yellow Tail Octopus etc. There are a variety of rolls with choices that have grown over the years and we each have our favorites. My current favorite is the Music City roll and of course the California roll. The ingredients in each roll are on the menu so no surprises there. 

We've also both had Chicken and Shrimp teriyaki and enjoyed both. It's never dry and always flavorful. The beer is always cold.

People have mentioned that you don't see many customers, however it all depends on the day and time. What many don't realize is Asahi also has a huge take out business! Our orders are split between take out and eat in but we have Asahi at least once a week.

We've eaten at other Sushi restaurants around town but Asahi is hands down our favorite. It's laid back and family friendly and easy to spot a neighbor or two. 

Many of the Yelp reviews are old for Asahi so I actually would not use Yelp as my primary review source for this restaurant.",2,"good"
"4","Dear god.
All I can say positive is that the owners are nice. But unfortunately, I can't taste ""nice"" in a sushi roll. The salads we had came with brown ginger dressing that was most certainly in a state of fermentation. The sushi I received has to be the worst I've ever eaten, grocery store sushi tastes better. We came in at 1pm, but were told they only had ""dinner menu"" prices, no lunch. I wish we had walked out then! The male owner asked me if the Philadelphia roll was supposed to come in cut up pieces! He didn't even know!  The food you see in the pictures I added cost $55!! They don't even have a soda fountain machine, just cans they pour into your cup. Do not waste your money. I wish we could have just picked other food off the menu, but it all was pretty bad.",1,"bad"
"5","The Google reviews were great so we were really excited to try, but sadly this was the worst sushi I have ever had, hands down. Wish we had checked Yelp before eating. They were nice, but worst meal ever. The menu had a ton of rolls with imitation crab or were fried with mayo on top, nothing special and most were quite uninspired and just strange. Couldn't find a standard roll, so tried to order closest to our taste. Now I know when I see a menu like that to just run.

Asked for no crab in one roll, the waitress proudly  brought out the roll without avocado, rather than omitting crab. But she did not understand English enough to fix this. Fine, but onto the rest. They all tasted fishy, like fish that had been brought to temperature incorrectly or had been stored too long. Just....bad. One roll taste kind of chemically, never tasted anything so awful, and I had nowhere to spit it out unfortunately. I tried a couple more, but still had that bad taste in my mouth! Even after a little ginger. The eel roll was....passable? But not tasty.

They were nice, but that is the good part. The meal was way too overpriced for the quality and the quality really makes me wonder about their food safety practices. Everything tastes like it was either going bad or already bad. Don't bother.",2,"bad"
