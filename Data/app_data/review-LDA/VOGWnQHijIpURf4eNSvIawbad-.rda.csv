"2","Tried out the new Chinese buffet today and gotta say it was quite good. The key(trick) to this is for the quality to continue. Too many times I have experienced newly opened Chinese buffets open with a bang! Great product, friendly service, a clean restaurant, well prepared food, and then it's slowly scaled back on all fronts in order to bleed out as much profit as possible. The next thing you know the place is closed and the cycle starts all over again. Lunch was a good value at @$6.49 per person. I wish them luck and hope they continue to keep a high level of quality in all facets of their business.",1,"good"
"3","First, I don't usually write reviews but decided to do so because of what I read.  After reading the reviews, we were somewhat reluctant to visit the restauarant, especially because the former oriental restauarant, Ichabahn (spelling may be wrong) was just ok, and something I would rate as 3 stars.  However our experience at this restaurant was much, much better.  Read about fish odors and there were none.  Read about not to eat seafood:  I ate the mussels, baby clams, oysters, shirmp in 3 different ways, talapia and all tasted good.  Tried several other items and all very good, but never made it to the desert section or grill.  Restaurant was about 80% full for a Saturday night and should have be much higher due to the assortment of good food and great prices.  Some reviews may have discouraged people from eating there and understandably so.  Waitresses were all very friendly with smiling faces.  Will definitely visit again.  The only suggestions I would make to the owners are:  1.)  Beer & wine menu should always be provided without asking and prices should be shown on menu.  2.)  Add ambiance by decreasing the starkness.  3.)  Reduce the bright lights with dimmer.  3.)  Paint the ceiling a darker color to reduce the appearance of its height and make the area cozier.  4.)  Do something with the stark walls.  And doing those things will make the restaurant a very comfortable and cozy restaurant and attract more customers.",2,"good"

DO NOT eat here!!!!! 

We went here after 4pm on Wednesday thinking that there would be crab legs..there is no posting stating that it is only Friday - Sunday. That was the first issue.

The food is not good. There is not a variety at all and assuming since it is a weekday they dont like to make sure what is on the buffet is fresh. The food was not of great quality , minimal and cold. 

The hibachi was meeehhhhh....I don't like that they have fresh eggs on the counter and they are very warm. They should have them in ice since they are sitting out for a while. 

This restaurant should not be called a buffet. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not return or tell anyone to go there. I remember seeing a post stating that they were trying to get things going as they were just opening. This restaurant has been opened long enough to know what people like and how to keep food hot and fresh..also a better variety.

If you are going to be in the Daytona area try Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet...this is a REAL asian buffet.

Imperial Asian Buffet needs to do better.",1,"bad"
"5","Close this review right now and start driving to The Shoppes at New Tampa.  Leave regret in your rearview mirror and don't EVER question your decision to drive the extra 17 minutes to Asian Buffet. 

Sure it's going to cost $1 more, but that's what it takes to avoid the deep sadness I'm feeling right now.  The differences between a $7.99 and $8.99 experience are astounding:

For starters, eating in a poorly planned cafeteria setting with power cords all over the walls and very misleading food images posted in the windows as you enter VS a modest exterior and an immediate eyeful of a buffet that punches you in the face with possibilities before you're brought to one of three separate dining areas.

Secondly, taking a first plate that already feels like you've settled for disappointment and shouda, woulda, coulda's VS a first plate that hasn't even scratched the surface of what looked delicious.

Third, did I mention how sad I am right now??

Fourth, 2 servers, 1 hibachi/sushi chef and 1 buffet attendant VS more staff than you can shake a stick at.  Don't get me wrong, this place has really nice servers but something has to make up for the stingy buffet tables they can't afford to even keep half full...

...and that's where I'll finish this up.  Compared to Asian Buffet, this place is a food desert and I had to fight through a scattered mess of fried or cheese covered insanity to find anything remotely Asian and/or healthy.  The move by places like this to cheapen their culinary culture to feed a bunch of fat Americans more calories than Asians will consume in a week is disgusting on so many levels.  I guess if you throw enough gawdy neon lights in a place and slap up a fish tank I'm supposed to be impressed by your exotic oriental heritage???

I'm over it.  The only thing Imperial here is the amount of failure they managed to pack into a single hour of my life!",2,"bad"
