"2","Ok, I get lazy sometimes with my compliments--I think we all might--when it comes to shouting accolades. We have come to expect great service from the industry. Having said that, it's time people take the time to 'write' a ""thank you, how awesome an experience it was"" note on our social media platforms! I mean, 70 % of us spend an inordinate amount of time in these forums, checking in on friends, finding the next great movie or scoping out restaurants! Yet, so few people take the time to let the world know how great the restaurants, the movie or your friends are. Well, I've decided I want to tell people that I had a great experience at Mizu! I'm from out of town and needed a decent (and cool) place for dinner on a Saturday. Mind you, I was in town with 8000 other folks from our convention and we virtually overwhelmed the restaurants around The America's Center. I found Mizu about .3 mikes from the convention center and when I walked in, I noticed a large 20+ table! Honestly, I grimaced. But...wait for it... I was greeted immediately by the nicest, most professional hostess! She brought me an ice cold water, offered me her glasses (can't see a darn thing without mine which I left in the room!) and then she so courteously offered me a hair tie--hers! She could tell I was nearly melting on this 104 degree day! Anyway--the food? I had an ice cold Sopporo before I had ordered crab Rangoon. So good! Then she made recommendations--I chose the Sexy Girl roll. It's delish! Anyway, to make a long story short--EAT HERE. The service and the food were spot on. If you stop in, say HI to Sue. She owns it and after talking to her, I learned Mizu is the only restaurant that has been in this area--a truly local place--for the past 10 years. So, what's that mean? Great restaurants do last. Give it a try--you won't be disappointed. Happy eating!      #lifeisgood #livehappy",1,"good"
"3","Downtown can be dead on Tuesday nights, but that didn't stop Mizu from offering a wonderful experience with great food.

For some reason or another, a few of its servers were hanging outside. They smiled and one of them opened the door for us, which is surprising since that rarely happens for me Downtown.

Our server was very polite and offered us a seat at the sushi bar so we can see our food in action. At first, I thought she was just pawning off a two-top off to another server but she stuck with us to the end. Her knowledge of the menu and the genuine way she described her favorite items sold us on a Dragon Ball, which was supposed to be an appetizer, but can be eaten as a meal. It was a tempura battered, deep-fried monster roll that seemed more like a burrito than sushi roll... Until they let it rest and cut it into ginormous, futomaki-on-steroids slices. Inside was a mass of neo-sushi, spice-creaminess finished with a crisp. Lovely... But was a TON of food.

Thankfully, a cup of very strong green tea hit the spot after that kind of spicy madness.

We ordered a chef's choice sushi plate and unagi (eel) bowl. What I really liked was that the server suggested that we share the sushi plate and treat the unagi bowl like another course, which is what we normally do at sushi places but was a welcome understanding of the logistics of preparing sushi (fast) compared to the assembly of a good unagi bowl (more about that in a bit).

The sushi chef was friendly and let us take photos of him while he sliced his way into our heart via sushi, which was fresh and just above room temperature. The delicate nigiri and rolls were served on top of a drizzle of sweet soy sauce, which just the right amount to accent the fish and rice without dipping them into soy ourselves. 

Our unagi bowl was simply fantastic. Probably the prettiest unagi bowl in town in my opinion. The eel wasn't overdone and was a healthy portion. It was garnished with two large slices of VERY tasty tamago (japanese omelet), shrimp, seaweed strips, and a wonderfully seasoned rice (not my favorite sushi rice, but up there). My only concern was that the plate might have been a little too busy for what I might consider a comfort food.

Now, on to dessert!

Our server suggested that we get the deep fried green tea ice cream. Yes, it was more fried stuff, but hey, she was on a roll with her menu choices. When this ""dessert"" came out, I blurted:

""You're f***ing kidding me??""

She smiled and set down this bowl, containing a meteoric fried ball of green tea ice cream, which seemed to be coated in white cake batter, panko crusted and deep fried. Slice that in half for a dramatic effect and throw some whipped cream in there and you have yourself a COMMITMENT.

The only downside to Mizu is that while I love the way they're liberal with their portions, it's not what I want when I go out for sushi (most times). A sushi outing should be an appreciation of fresh sea food, and complete satisfaction. While I experienced both fresh and satisfaction, my distended belly made me realize that I over ordered. The next time around, I'll be more conservative on what I order.

Great place!",2,"good"
"4","I notice a lot of these begin with ""I'm new to sushi"".  Just to be clear, I am not new to sushi.  I've been eating sushi heavily for about 2 decades, on both coasts, throughout the Midwest (don't laugh, some of the Midwestern cities have large Asian populations and fantastic sushi) and in Japan.  I make my own sushi (usually chirashi, because, well, lazy, plus love that style of rice).  And I simply like to eat raw food, including steak, so I'm finnicky about freshness.

Mizu looked like it would be a nice spot to hit in St Louis; easy to find, and as a city-center restaurant, presumably pretty good to compete.  But it turned out to be pretty much all location.  I wouldn't go back, especially with so many other nearby options.

First, let's start with service.  Yes, they were absolutely understaffed.  Although the place was barely full (we were the only ones waiting) it still took a long time to get people their bills, get the table cleared, and get us seated.  Then, it took even longer for our waiter to get to us.  For some reason, he decided the girls at our table were in charge of ordering, and, after getting only part of their orders, scurried off....without even checking with the guys.  This sort of uncoordinated, fragmented, inefficient back-and-forth continued the whole time....in the end, we had orders we didn't make arriving at our table, orders we did place not showing, and absolutely no effort to keep us all eating at the same time.  

They skimp a bit on the food; standards like miso and salad weren't included, but hey, fine.  Tea was not replenished.  We ordered a few different appetizers and meals; because there was no tempura appetizer, we got that as a meal (appetizer quantity, plus rice).  Pretty much anything deep fried tasted fine.  Not mind-bending, but fine.  The pepper-based appetizer was lovely.

But you come to a sushi restaurant for some high quality fish and unique, tasty maki.  This place had neither.  The maki were bland, no unique flavoring even with unusual names and descriptions.  The sushi...well, I got my usually chirashi, and I wish I'd stuck to deep fried, because that might have covered the low quality of the fish.  Oh, one or two types were good...but the majority were mediocre.  Squashy and stale-tasting, with that crumbly texture that suggests freezing and freezer burn; the salmon tasted washed out, the tuna was definitely going off, and these are high-use sushi mainstays; of all the fish there, these should have been the types least likely to be sitting for the week it tasted like they'd been sitting.

How would it compare to my local sushi?  It had nothing on the Quad Cities area's two  top competitors, Shogun and Osaka, in terms of quality and freshness, despite beating them on price by about 25-30%.  Sad to say, it didn't even exceed my expectations for one of the QCA's older sushi restaurants, SuperTarget.  Yeah, that's right, SuperTarget outdoes this place on everything but style; they have an onsite chef who takes personal pride in his work and his fish, and I've almost never had less than fresh offerings there, although nothing so stellar as our actual Japanese restaurants.  The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but it's a freakin' SuperTarget; the service is better.

In the end, the hostess came over to apologize, but it was waaaay too late.  And too little; I had a minor misorder issue at Taki in Des Moines, and despite it being a busy night, that restaurant's head chef took a personal interest, sent us over the best fish they had in that night, treated us to another appetizer and a round of drinks, came over to apologize personally, and did an impromptu round of sake bombs with us.  And we hadn't even been kept waiting long, had other food in the interim, and might never have realized our order hadn't come on time.  We essentially never stopped eating (especially once the free appetizers started showing up)...we just weren't eating in the order that chef felt best represented his restaurant, and he expected better from his staff.  He took so much pride in his work that, while busy, he noticed an issue and corrected it before it was an issue to us, and he did it in such a way as to make me supremely confident of good service and sushi at his restaurant.  (I will say that for take out, I favor Appare's chirashi.  It just...doesn't...end.  And has multiple types of preserves/ salads (octopus and seaweed).  And more sushi than even I know what to do with.)

Mizu is probably a fine place to go to be seen, hang out at the bar with a cocktail, and pretend you're into sushi, if that's still a reason to pay for a high-priced dinner and lousy service.  But if you actually like sushi, I wouldn't recommend it, and if you're just starting out on sushi, absolutely not!  you'll never eat it again.  Wait, more for me.  Yes, newcomers to sushi, you go there.",1,"bad"

Decent food and service ruined by ownership cheapness. 

The beautiful wife and I decided to try this place out the other day as it is nearby our usual Japanese place (Wasabi) and wanted to try something different.  The place has a nice overall look and feel.   The servers were pretty good.  We ordered a spicy tuna roll, udon noodles, and the Mizu fusion bowl which was basically like bulgogi with rice and some veggies.  Kind of like a bibimbap without the egg.  Overall the food was decent but nothing amazing.  The spicy tuna tasted good, but the rolls weren't as tight, and the sushi tended to fall apart a little more than it should.  Also, the thickness of the rice layer in the sushi was more variable and generally thicker than at other Japanese restaurants such as Wasabi or Chi.  This caused the flavor to be a little more lost. The spicy tuna filling was comparable to Wasabi.  The bulgogi in the fusion bowl was a little dry and kind of bland compared to other places such as JuJu's or Hoagie city.  The quality of the udon noodles was a little less than Wasabi as was the broth but still pretty decent.  

Overall I'd give the food a solid 3 stars.  The servers were 4 star.   So why the 1 star review?  Unfortunately there was an issue with the diet coke I ordered.  After taking a sip it was clear to me that the fountain that it came from was not using enough syrup.  Hence the soda was much more watery tasting.  Not a problem.  I sent it back, explaining to the server what the situation was and asking for some coffee instead.  Well a few minutes later the server came back to explain that the they had ""fixed"" the soda machine and that I should try it again.  I took a taste, and while it seemed a little better it still wasn't what it should be.  So I said that I would prefer it be taken off my bill and that I didn't want it.  The server explained to me that in any case, the owner refused to give me a refund on my soda and left the ""soda"" on the table.  This is completely unacceptable.   I have never once heard of a restaurant that wouldn't cancel a soft drink order when the soft drink doesn't taste right.  That the owner would charge me for a soda that likely costs him 20 cents at most to make instead of just take it off my bill is not only bad service but downright insulting.   When I calmly pointed this out to the server, she said that she would approach the owner about this a second time but was not looking very hopeful that he would change his mind.  I told her not to worry about it.  At nearly every restaurant, removing a charge for something that tastes bad and is returned uneaten is standard operating procedure.  Not so at Mizu.  It seems that the owner would do anything to save 20 cents even if it means insulting his customers.    

Bottom line, the food and service were still not as good as Wasabi so I doubt we will be going back any time soon.   I probably would have returned every so often just for something a little bit different but at this point, I have no interest in rewarding an owner like that with repeat business.",2,"bad"
