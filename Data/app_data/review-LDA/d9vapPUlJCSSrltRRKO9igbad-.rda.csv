"2","Had dinner here on a Monday evening while I was in town on a business trip.

Service was fast and attentive. I had their $19.99 sushi special, which includes 10 pieces of Nigiri and a tuna roll. I asked the chef if he would change out the tuna roll for a spicy tuna roll, and he went one better and recommended the crunchy spicy tuna roll. Very good call; the roll was delicious.

The special included salad (just lettuce with dressing) and miso soup. Salad wasn't anything special but the miso was hot and tasty.

The rest of the special was good. Fish was fresh and quantities were good. My only comment is that it would have been nice if the chef or waitress had shown me exactly which types of fish were served, as it's pretty much chef's choice. I do know that it included two tuna, a yellow tail, a Krab (I don't think it was authentic but it might have been), an octopus, a salmon, and what I think was mackerel (it was a pretty pungent, oily fish). 

I enjoyed my meal here and would definitely recommend it to others. At $20 the sushi special is a pretty good value, quality and quantity was just right, and service was excellent.",1,"good"
"3","Close to my house, good service, decent prices, and decent food.  I'll probably be back.

I placed a to-go order on a Wednesday night.  She said it would be ready in 10 minutes, and I warned them that I wouldn't be there for 20-25 minutes.  She said she'd delay it so it wouldn't sit out.  I got there in 20 minutes, and they had everything together except the ice cream, which she pulled from the freezer (only took 1-2 minutes) and I left happy.  

When I got home, I noticed two problems.  First, the bag smelled very fishy.  Second, there was no soy sauce.  Well, ok, I have soy sauce in my fridge, so that problem was solved.  And, after some investigation, I discovered that the fishy smell was coming from the miso soup, not the sushi.  

Despite the smell, the miso soup was pretty good.  I've definitely had better, but it was definitely not the worst, either.  

I ordered a rainbow roll and chirashi, my standard order when trying a new place.  I also ordered some ice cream for later.  The ice cream was the only thing that wasn't well-priced: surprisingly expensive at $4.50.  Without that, my 'normal' order came to around $30.  

The rainbow roll was pretty good: the fish was fresh and flavorful.  The chirashi was also good EXCEPT for the hamachi, which was definitely on it's way out.  I didn't eat it.  I think there is maybe a problem with the supplier in the area, since this is the second sushi place this week that's had problems with hamachi.  I think I will avoid any further hamachi sushi until spring.  That said, assuming you avoid the hamachi, all the rest of the fish was quite good and fresh (not great, but good), and the price was good, too. 

Service - 4.5 stars (would have been 5 if it weren't for the missing soy sauce)
Price - 4 stars
Food - 3 stars

To be fair, I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, so I have very high standards.  However, there are two other sushi places in Tampa that I give 5 stars for the food (I Ai & Sushi Cafe), so it's not impossible.  Still, this is far better than Takara, and closer to my house than the other two, so I'll probably be back.",2,"good"
"4","I'm guessing there is new management or at least a name change because this place used to be called Soho Sushi North. I tried this place out today for lunch (after Wood Fried Pizza was closed). The server was really friendly and attentive. I ordered off of their lunch menu and did the Pick Two sushi rolls ($10.99) which comes with a choice of miso soup or ginger salad. I chose the Soho Roll (tuna, salmon, tempura chips, roe) and Japanese Bagel (swapped out the smoked salmon for fresh salmon, cream cheese). Pretty basic rolls and I chose the miso soup. I also ordered the crab rangoon.

The sushi was... o....k. They were really small rolls. The fish looked fresh and were rolled nicely but there was a taste to them. Like they were just bland, not even a fish taste if that makes sense. Even the wasabi tasted bland and the soy sauce tasted bland! It kind of felt like I was just chewing. 

The miso soup was average, good. I like miso soup especially when there's the little tofu inside. 

Crab rangoon ($6.99) : was filled with what looked like krab mix they use in their rolls and was wrapped like a gyoza instead of like a wonton or even a triangle. Not bad, but definitely not the taste I was looking for. 

I wanted to really like this place especially since the service was good and everything looked clean and the food came out REALLY QUICK! I was in and out of there in 30 minutes which was perfect. They also offer a 10% discount for USF and medical professionals and they honored it even for the lunch special! Free wi-fi also. 

But all in all with tip included, I felt like I kind of wasted $21. I also realized that the prices for the rolls individually are $5.99 and $4.99 so the $10.99 lunch is actually more expensive (by 1 cent) but you get a side I guess.",1,"bad"
"5","I am not new to sushi restaurants. I have been to many, and have a definite idea of what good sushi is and what bad sushi is. This was BAD sushi. As a USF student, getting 10% off by showing my ID is very exciting. Unfortunately, I would have rather paid more elsewhere and received an edible dinner. 

The first red flag was showing up at ""happy hour"" and there being only one other group inside the restaurant. The menu for happy hour sushi was also more expensive than their regular menu for the same items, which was confusing. Another red flag was that most of the rolls listed were marked with an asterisk as cooked...when there is only a handful of raw sushi options, you know your meal is going to be questionable. 

I started with the ginger salad, which was a laughable loose handful of iceberg lettuce, string cut carrots, and a swamping of dressing. I could have poured the leftover, watery dressing into a wine glass. I asked about their special, which I think was called ""Smokey"", because I am a fan of smoked raw salmon...the waiter cringed and recommended I try something else. I should have left after that. 

The smoked salmon was listed as cooked, which also shocked me because anywhere else I go, restaurants cold-smoke their fish. It shouldn't be cooked at all, just flavored with smoke. After inquiring about the Salmon Lover's smoked roll, the waiter said that yes, it's cooked, but it has the texture of raw fish. Sounds fake, but okay...I ordered it, hoping I was misunderstanding him.

The rolls came out quickly, but the meal itself would have gone quicker had they just thrown it into the trash after making it rather than bring it to my table. The ""smoked"" salmon didn't taste smoky, and they had the texture of raw fish because it WAS raw--and beyond safe food temperatures! it didn't flake like cooked salmon and was slimy. It tasted spoiled. The tempura flakes inside the roll also had a disgusting, bitter taste that overpowered the entire roll. I didn't eat the rest of it, and hoped they'd take it off my bill. It was $12 for that monstrosity, and I was praying that I didn't get food poisoning from the few bites I risked. I told the waiter I didn't like it, and when he returned with my bill, the nasty roll remained but it appeared he had removed the cost of my $2 salad. Yippee.

Ultimately, the whole experience was absurd and a waste of time. I was there with two other friends, one of which who also eats raw sushi and didn't enjoy her experience either, and one who exclusively eats cooked rolls. She thought her food was good. 
If your frame of reference of good sushi is cooked(?) or store-bought, this is your place.
Otherwise, save your money and avoid food poisoning--STAY AWAY!
I will never be coming back here.",2,"bad"
