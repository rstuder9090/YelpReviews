"2","Great place for to go Terriaki!  The owner barely speaks English but is nice.  There is basically one dish: chicken teriyaki with rice (fried or steamed) noodles, or veggies.  I get the double meat with extra sauce.  Don't eat there, not a great atmosphere but that's not what it is.  Call in 10 min ahead of time, pay, and go.",1,"good"
"3","Pretty decent Japanese for a great price. Not to mention, you get a whole heap of food. Meals are between $5 and $7, and are cooked quickly. You can also request more teriyaki sauce.

The vegetables are mostly cabbage, although I found a small piece of broccoli in mine, leading me to believe that the vegetables may sometimes contain it. The rice is very good, and the meat is just okay.

All in all, I think the meal is worth the price, and I'd definitely come here again if I were in the area and looking for a cheap and fast meal.",2,"good"
