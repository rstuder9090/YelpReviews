"2","Marketing idea - sell souvenir Thida Thai tie-dyed Thai ties!

But I bet it would be hard to tie a Thida Thai tie-dyed Thai tie.

For my birthday my daughter and son-in-law wanted to take my wife and I out to eat. They frequent here often and I have wanted to try it based on their reviews as well as my mother-in-laws. It is quaint and unassuming - quite place to relax. We didn't have to wait for a table, which was kind of strange based on the quality and flavor of the food. I got the Pad Thai and got some on my Thai tie-dyed...sorry, time to get off that pony...

Anything on the menu you can adjust the heat/spice level. I ordered my green tea ice cream extra spicy...OK seriously, being adventurous I chose the Pad Thai at heat level 5 - excellent choice! Noodles cooked just right. At lots of places either your food is hot with no flavor or lots of flavor but no heat. This had a perfect balance. I reviewed a hot chicken place last week that was high on heat, but the flavor was not there. There was one green curry and one red curry ordered by the family - I forgot the name of what my wife ordered, but it was similar to a bamboo chicken dish served at Omni Hut, but with more vegetables. All were excellent! Crab Rangoon was really tasty as were the spring rolls - dishes presented very nicely with carved veggies and such. Service was excellent as well.

I have been craving their Pad Thai since our visit - almost went the next day. Think I'll go shrimp next time...then beef the next day or maybe pork...or both...",1,"good"

We had attended the first Sunday service at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch since the mass shooting had taken place. I used to be the youth minister and one of the song leaders there. The minister that was shot was my wife's youth minister in the 70's and she was involved with the children's ministry. The hero was in my youth group. You might be thinking, ""You just left such a somber occasion and you are making jokes?"" Well, you should have heard the minister! He has always used humor in his sermons. ""Well, I guess I won't be giving anymore 5 point sermons!"" He had his index finger completely shot off. He made reference to a nearby church opening its doors so parishioners would have a place to stay while the investigation was going on - to which he stated, ""I didn't go."" He was rushed to the hospital. He shared that a fellow school basketball coach told him he couldn't number one anymore.  He had called my wife a few weeks before asking her to come visit him (her best friend goes there). His first words to her - ""I guess I have to get shot for you to come see me!"" Afterwards I walked up to him - ""HIGH FOUR!"" He told everyone after the service that he wanted to talk to each and every one and would be sitting up front. ""The news people want to talk to me, but they can wait - they're getting paid."" He WILL turn tragedy into triump...

Back to the review after that brief interruption - didn't want you to think I am callous - I have a couple, but I'm not (another pun if you are keeping count). Our daughter and her husband and probably the cutest eleven month old grandson in the world met us there. We stayed for the news interviews and were there until about 1:30. We asked the kids if they wanted to eat with us - they did. I suggested KFC - they all suggested I think again. I suggested deli subs from Publix, they suggested I go change the baby's diaper. After changing the messy diaper I got this unexplainable urge for a refried bean burrito so I suggested Taco Bell - they all suggested I shut up. Our daughter suggested Thida Thai - I guess a three fourths majority rules - no bean burrito with extra onions and fire sauce for me this day.

None of us have been since they moved to their new location. I had written a previous review, but it was from the old location. This new place is, and I cannot help re-using this word for them - AWESOME! Anything else would be a disservice. We chose to sit outside under the covered section of the patio. While it was hot in the sun, under here, with a breeze blowing, it was perfect! The owner recognized our kids from when they used to go to the old location quite a bit. She didn't recognize me - why didn't she recognize me? Give me a minute....my feelings are hurt....OK, I'm better, my grandson gave me a hug. We also order 2 orders of egg rolls and one crab Rangoon - delicious as always. For entrees we all ordered something different - wait that's not true. Yes it is - even though the three of them order the exact same thing - it was something they had never had, so that makes it different - right? I guess they all had the same thing only different - you decide. Since I am the only one that TRULY got something different, let's start with me - I had the Rad Nah. Oh man was it good! It was like getting an entr√©e and soup all in one dish. ""How on earth am I going to eat all that?!"" As it turned out - one spoonful at a time. They all got the Green Dragon Vegetable Roll that came with salad and Miso soup. Miso glad they did - I told you the well wasn't dry! Did they like it? Well, sorta - OK I'm kidding the LOVED it - my wife especially. YAY! I really enjoy this place and she is trying to eat lighter, fresher - so be back soon.  OH! On another review site, I had written a review of another Thai place where I had ordered Pad Prik. They edit their reviews for possible offensive referenced - I had to prove to them  - that I wasn't a 12 year old boy I guess - and that was indeed the name of the dish!",2,"good"
