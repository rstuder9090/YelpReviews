"2","So excited to have another healthily and delicious restaurant in Hernando County!  Went with a party of five, so we had a nice menu assortment at the table.  Everything was delicious.  My favorite was the spicy tuna salad which was light (no mayo....finally!) and the goyza.  The fancy roll and spicy tuna roll looked terrific.  Beautiful plate presentation.  They pre-bussed the tables (which is usually a lost step in service at most restaurants around here), filled our drinks without us needing to ask and served the kitchen orders quickly.  Sushi took a little longer, but that is to be expected. Excellent job and terrific food! Yea Hernando!

Oh....as to the review about size...they do not put a lot of rice in their rolls.  I personally prefer less rice so the flavor of the fish is more prominent.  That is a personal preference and not deserving of three stars.",1,"good"
"3","Just want to comment on ""Michael G.'s"" review. We were actually there on September 7th and seated RIGHT BEHIND THEM when their kid got sick. Why would THE RESTAURANT apologize for your kid throwing up everywhere? If you were implying he got food poisoning literally 5 minutes after eating their food, please try to make your story more realistic. You can't get food poisoning that fast. And since we were THERE that night, we had sushi and an entree from the kitchen and DID NOT get food poisoning. And according to Michael's other reviews his kid threw up at ANOTHER restaurant? Maybe instead of spending your time and energy posting bogus reviews for no reason, you can take your son to the doctor because he obviously has some dietary issues. I reported his bogus review and hope it gets deleted, because also, ew? Who posts photos like that to Yelp? 

Now, for the review of the actual restaurant. I have been going to this place for as long as it's been open. I have take-out ordered here MANY times and have dined here and It's always clean and the food is extremely fresh. It is one of (if not the best) place in Spring Hill for sushi. I think *one* time the service was a bit slow but not anything to complain about. We just dined here again tonight and the sushi was fantastic along with the service (and it was pretty busy). The restaurant is also very nicely decorated and hip. My only complaints are that the takeout orders do take longer sometimes and that they have recently hiked the prices up on their food. But there has never been any concern over cleanliness or taste of the food.",2,"good"
