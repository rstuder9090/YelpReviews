"2","I happened to be in the area for a client and met up with my brother after work.  He talks about Miyabi's all the time (he works close by).  So finally I had the chance to see the hype.

We ordered and shared the Godzilla roll (Salmon, tuna and white fish roll deep fried with chef 's special spicy sauce and caviar), Incredible roll (Shrimp tempura avocado inside topped with spicy crabmeat and special sauce), Infinity roll (Crunchy spicy tuna topped with smoked eel, avocado, caviar and sweet sauce, and the Amazing roll (Spicy crab and avocado inside topped with crunchy spicy tuna and bonito flake).  All of these specialty rolls were priced at $6.95 and a really good value for the quality.

I wasn't really a fan of the deep fried roll, but only because I don't normally like too much tempura batter.  My favorite was the Amazing roll, the bonito flakes really added to the flavor.  

I had no issues with service.  I had my hot tea refilled quickly.  If I was closer in the area, I'd probably stop by more often.",1,"good"
"3","My family orders takeout from here on a decently regular basis and have also celebrated a few birthdays in the restaurant. We've never had a bad experience or had them forget anything in the take out orders.

I always order one of the sushi combos and I love that it comes with miso soup and their salad with the ginger dressing. Lately I've been getting the salmon lover combo which I will be including a picture of with my review. It's delicious and makes this salmon addict a happy camper. The spider roll is also good and consists of tempura fried soft shell crab. 

The tempura ice cream is amazing though, My parents, sister, brother in law, nieces, boyfriend and I all had some after our meals and were in love.",2,"good"
