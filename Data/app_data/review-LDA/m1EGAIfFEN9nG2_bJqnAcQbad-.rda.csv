"2","Reno loves sushi. Specifically, Reno loves ""All You Can Eat"" sushi, which makes sense in a college town known for buffet-style dining. At least 35 restaurants in the area are serving AYCE sushi, versus 25 steak houses (a third of which are casino-based). I find this kind of amazing in a land-locked area known for cattle ranching.

Every Reno sushi fan will tell you about a favorite spot, but favorites are a fickle business. When a new sushi bar opens, loyalties can shift on a single visit. I'm no better than the rest. I've tried at least 20 of the current bunch, and my ""favorite place"" has changed at least half as many times. Enter Sushi Minato, the latest ""hot spot"" on Reno's sushi map.

Located in the Smithridge Shopping Center, the entrance has all the charm a strip mall can afford. Upon entering, though, you're met with a very modern, austere-yet-tasteful ambiance that is pleasant and welcoming. Seating is cozy, with perhaps 15 seats at the bar and table seating for 20. My wife and I usually sit at the bar, but we chose table seating in order to give the staff a proper test. Herein lays the greatest strength of Sushi Minato: service.

At risk of hyperbole, I'd say that Sushi Minato has the best service of any sushi bar I've visited. The servers were very attentive, despite a busy Saturday lunch crowd. AYCE at Sushi Minato is $17.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner. The food arrived from the chefs incredibly fast, yet didn't look rushed. Despite the above-average service, we did find a couple of items missing from our first order. Then again, it was a big order, and they fixed the errors quickly. For appetizers, we ordered gyoza (average), mussels (great flavor and texture), edamame (hot and salted, as they should be), miso soup and tempura cheese sticks. The miso was a standout, served piping hot with plenty of nori, scallion and tofu. I tried the tempura cheese sticks because they seemed out of place, and the best thing I can say is the mustard sauce was tasty. Not bad, but there are better items on the menu.

Reviewing a sushi bar could be an exercise in listing all the ingredients. However, let's focus on the stand-outs. The rice itself was just as it should be, not overdone. Nigiri is my favorite form of sushi, and all the nigiri tasted fresh and had great texture. Nigiri stars were octopus, seared tuna and cooked scallop. Of the raw long rolls we tried, the Minato and WinWin were tops, though the Chloe and Tania cooked rolls were really tasty. My wife enjoyed the Dani roll (for those who love cilantro). The Leaf roll lacked any distinguishing flavor. The only item that really missed the mark was the Rainbow roll. The layers of fish seemed a bit small in their version of this standard, which was surprising given how generous the chefs were with other items.

A crystal shrimp handroll is something I always try at every new spot, perhaps because it was the first hand roll I ever ordered (20 years ago). Sushi Minato's version is pure simplicity: deep-fried shrimp, avocado, sushi rice, all wrapped in a cone of dried nori with zero distractions (though I usually add a dash of soy sauce). Sushi Minato easily owns the high water mark on this favorite.

Finally, I'd be remiss if I failed to mention that the house hot sake was among the best I've ever had, definitely from a higher shelf than what you'll find at most sushi joints. Sushi Minato definitely warrants a repeat visit.",1,"good"
"3","We've become quite regulars here and I've hesitated to write this review because we don't want them to get too popular and thus crowded and have to wait, but we do want them to stay busy and reap the rewards of running a good business.  

They almost always have a special running that gives you a discount on their already reasonable AYCE price or you get free warm sake.  The staff is so welcoming and very accommodating for my child which means the world to me as a new mom.  My baby barely eats, but they do not balk at me feeding him off my orders and even bring me extra tofu cubes or diced avocado for him to eat without charge.  

The food is solid.  They offer a variety of appetizers and dessert included in both lunch and dinner.  Also, BIG plus is they don't restrict rolls to dinner only, you can have everything on the ayce menu lunch or dinner time.  some creative combinations that are unique with a light touch on sauces (the overuse of sweet sauces ruins some of the other ayce places imo).  The rolls here are always tight and they have the best rice to nigiri ratio I've seen anywhere.  I know the idea at AYCE places is to get you stuffed off of cheap rice, but they do not do that here!  We love the mussels, really good savory broth and a small dollop of sweet japanese mayo and sriracha.  I'm tempted to come here and just make a meal of mussels one day.  Last time we were here we ordered 7 orders and they did not flinch at all. (some places limit you to 2 order per person). They are great at modifications (ie: no cream cheese please!  extra jalapeno please! no sauce please!)  I've heard the chefs are good at making on the fly creations if you guide them with what you like, but we've never run out of things on the existing menu to order (we usually are stuffed before trying everything that sounds good and have our favorites so we don't get bored yet)

We also have had their bento box lunches and it's a great filling meal for $12.  you get an entree with soup/salad tempura and ANY roll of your choice.  The only thing I would not recommend is the udon.  I thought it was kind of bland.  They are supportive of other local business, I noticed they keep a basket with samples from Kimmies candies on the end of the sushi bar.  We always take a small pouch of chocolate sunflower seeds or chocolate rocks home.",2,"good"
"4","Arrived @ 4:30pm & promptly seated at a table; only about 6 other people there.  Nice ambiance, roomy, clean bathroom; music a little too loud. We each received a small dish four our soy sauce & wasabi & 1 medium-sized dish that included wasabi & ginger.  About 90 degrees outside, but felt less than 60 degrees inside (glad I brought a hoody).  Good service.  Sushi:  small pieces; fish-DRY; I like mostly traditional sushi without too much sauce, etc, NO on the cream cheese & peppers for me.  I felt as though I was eating a lot of sauce and other add-ons rather than fish. Mountain Role good, but  small in size, a little dry, and would have rather had more salmon & tuna & less crystal shrimp. The unagi was dry and I would compare it to a soft piece of jerky w/sauce on it; same with upside down shrimp - very small!  My friend had cajun ""something"" and tasted the sauce, but not the fish.  Will I go back?  Probably not.  Fortunately, Reno has other choices.  Dinner $25 each.",1,"bad"
"5","Well, the nail is in the coffin I suppose. What was once the best sushi place in Reno, has definitely lost it's flair. While the sushi tastes good (it used to be MUCH better) it's just not the same as it was.

Upon entering the restaurant since the last time, we were relieved to notice the bar was empty, perfect, we'll get our food quick, and it'll be right :)


NOPE. Holy shnikes I couldn't have been more wrong. I sit down with my girlfriend, and I order a Timo and a Dani off the bat, she orders a roll and then we wait....and wait... And I finally get the Dani... And then we wait more... Finally we're asked ""Do you guys want anything else?"" Uh, yeah, the first two rolls that still haven't came out. We tell them we're waiting, and then they say that the rolls will take a few minutes (beyond the 10 we've been waiting, when there are 6 people in the restaurant?) and if we want another roll. We said we'll wait.

The rolls finally come out, and a huge problem I have with many sub-par sushi restaurants is the intense fishy smell and flavor of their fish. High quality restaurants DO NOT have this problem, and Sushi Minato never used to either, except this time I couldn't taste anything except that horrid fishy flavor. Geeze, did you guys turn into Ijji?

Then I noticed something, none of the chefs were the ones I had grown used to, and they all looked like the guys who were at Ijji the last time I went there. Awww crap.


Well long story short, we had a few rolls just disappear on us to never appear again, we were CONSTANTLY being asked by all 4 sushi chefs if we wanted more rolls (trying to get us to take more so the cooked rolls won't be eaten? Crappy business tactic to get money) and a water and 2 all you can eat lunches was $40.XX



Was a regular, used to get sushi weekly from here, now I'm looking for a new place, and you should too.",2,"bad"
