"2","I have been to Benihana twice.  The first time was in March 2011 for my friend's birthday.  We had a great time and so I decided to sign up for their birthday club, which gives you $30 towards your meal during the month of your birthday, and we went again last week for my birthday. 

This place is definitely better with a group.  Both times we went, it was my husband, my friend, her husband, her 2 1/2 year old son, and myself.  Since we didn't take up a whole table, which seats 8, they fill the seats with strangers, which is fine, but might have been awkward if we weren't in a group.  The other 4 people at our table were 2 couples who were not together, and they all seemed a little shy towards the rest of the table.  Of course the big thing at a place like this is the show.  While the tricks are pretty much the same, both times our chef was pretty good at entertaining us while he cooked our food.  

Anyway, both times I went I ordered the same thing:  the spicy tofu steak.  Most, if not all of the meals, come with the option of plain or chicken fried rice.  Since I am a vegetarian, they made mine veggie fried rice, which the chef was good enough to acknowledge and remember without me even having to tell him after I placed the order with the waitress.  I was also pleased that when I inquired about the onion soup that came with the meal, the waitress not only knew that it was a beef-based broth (you'd be surprised how many waiters/waitresses do not understand that just becuase a soup doesn't have chunks of meat in it doens't mean it is vegetarian), but she also offered me a substitute of the miso soup, which was very good.  All of our meals were also served with a salad with that good Asian ginger dressing.

Becuase my meal did not cost the $30 I was entitled to, the waitress encouraged me to order some apps and side dishes, which I did for our group.  The only thing about the birthday coupon is that it is only good for the person whose birthday it is. And they check ID!  So, I couldn't give it to my husband, whose meal cost a lot more than mine.  

At the end, they bring out a free bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce for the birthday person and sing.  Now, I am not a fan of this.  Unfortunately, becuase you are using the birthday coupon, there is no avoiding it.  But, it's free ice cream, so I'll suck up the embarrassment and eat my ice cream.  It's not too embarrassing though, becuase usually there is at least one birthday person at every table.  That coupon is a big draw!  

They also take your picture with your group, which is a little cheesy, but still cute.  Since the couple we were with are very good friends of ours, and their son is my Godson, I'll take the cheesiness.  

So, in 11 months I went to Benihana twice, both for birthdays.  In the future, I would definitely like to go again, but probably will only go when we have a birthday coupon.  Maybe I'll sign my husband up for his May birthday just for another excuse to go then.",1,"good"
"3","Went around 4 pm and had an early dinner.

The food:

I had the splash and meadow which comes with soup, salad with ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer and onions. The splash and meadow is steak and shrimp. I always order my steak medium well everywhere I go however I have never truly eaten a medium well steak until today.  All of my food was perfectly cooked. Israel, the chef did a great job with the show as well. Put yourself in their shoes and think of how great of a chef you would be here!

My fiance had colossal shrimp and we shared a philly roll and crunchy roll everything was amazing. I really think it was because it was so early however the food is always great here but it was exceptional today.

The service:

I mainly wrote this review because I saw complaints of the service. Even at their worse the service is above and beyond any chain. The waitress asks if you have visited before, reviews specials, and explain the process if it's your first time or you need some guidance.  Also they are refilling your water and soft drinks before you need it so you are never without a drink. Most importamtly, they ask if you need another alcoholic drink and usually have it to you in a few minutes. Their hot green tea is very satisfying after a large meal.  They provide attentive service without being over bearing. If you are celebrating a special occasion they will sing to you with tambourines and will bring our a scoop of ice cream with a candle... mmm green tea ice cream!

I have been here countless times and if you are in the mood for hibachi BENIHANA is your place. I don't understand how other reviews complained about this location. 

Happy Hour:
Also Monday - Thursday? I'm not sure they have happy hour on friday. I believe the hours are 5-7 pm their happy hour specials are definitely worth trying for drinks and sushi. Their sushi is always fresh. This is in the bar area only though. The service at the bar is not equivalent to the service you receive in the main dining area however,  keep in mind they are usually very busy during Happy hour and most times the entire bar area only has two bartenders servicing the restaurant and making drinks for everyone else in the restaurant.",2,"good"
"4","First ever Yelp review. That says something. Sorry its so long but needs to be out there. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS PLACE HAS LOST IT. If I could give 0 stars I would. Visited last week. I've been here many times and the experience has been declining over the years but this is the last straw. I will NOT EVER waste another penny on this location.

Our original chef was inexperienced. I get that experience needs to be gained somehow, but they should not be placed with a table of 7, with complicated orders, while the table of 2 next to us were served by themselves with an experienced chef. The inexperienced chef should have served the table of 2. The 2 table obviously knew the manager, as they spoke with her quite a bit. Maybe this is why they were treated to private dining with the experienced chef? Don't know. 

Our chef over-cooked and poorly sliced the shrimp appetizer (inexperience)- wasting part of the already small appetizer. Vegetables were pre-sliced in the kitchen. No tricks were performed. Fried rice was poorly prepared. Soup was served luke-warm at best.  All portions are evidently now more strictly controlled under new management, as was explained, with an attitude, by the replacement chef(head chef/KITCHEN MANAGER) who replaced the first chef, and was apparently not happy in having to do so. He also decided to give us a brief education about profit and loss in regard to the recently implemented portion controls he had put in place. Totally unprofessional. He should be more concerned with guest experience. If I don't return, he'll have no need to worry about my portion size. Hint to him: if you're going to expect me to accept the chef inexperience, treat me to a little extra while your employee learns on my dime. 

My steak, which was ordered medium, was then prepared by the ""experienced"" chef and cooked to well done. While cooking he also was asking other staff for something he was missing but couldn't get it, so he stormed off in a huff to retrieve it. The item turned out to be a whistle so he could imitate a train at the very end for the ONE trick performed during this mess for the ten year old birthday boy at the table. We were a party of 2 and the others at our table were a party of 3 and a party of 2. None of us knew each other. There were a total of 3 birthdays at the table, including myself. 

After the poor preparation of the shrimp appetizer, vegetables, fried rice, and soup, the concerns were relayed to the front manager. She did try and address the issues. The original chef was then replaced and when it was done it caused a dramatic scene for one of the other diners, who felt it was inappropriate. Oddly enough, this woman's companion was the most vocal complainer and he refused to eat the food as prepared. He didn't eat until the chef was replaced and I'm guessing his meal was comped to appease him. There was no need to replace the chef at this point, the damage was done. It was also relayed that original chef was upset at the situation, and was reluctant to return to the floor.

The front manager did attempt to soothe the discontent by comping a round of drinks but too little, too late. I have been to this Benihana many times in over 30 years and this was for my birthday celebration. This was absolutely the worst experience I've had there, hands down. My meal and celebration were completely ruined by the overall situation. The ordeal lasted 2 hours and I couldn't wait for it to be over, not the experience expected nor deserved. The 2 table came in after us and were finished before us.

This was obviously not the new chef's fault, as she was put in the position by management. I overheard it was her third day, and her assignments should be set with that experience in mind.

As we left it was good to see she was back on the floor serving a table of 8. Glad to see she was over it quickly and best of luck to her.",1,"bad"
"5","WARNING: Be aware of whom you speak to while making reservations and confirming use of gift cards. (jot down name of person you speak with)

Made reservations for 4 people. Called back to add one more person. Total ""5"". When I called back the rep said I had ""8"" people under my reservation. She verified the spelling of my name and corrected party to 5 guest, for 6pm 10.13.16.  

When reservation was updated I specifically wanted to verify if the ""Be the Chef"" gift card, could be used for the reserved dinner. The rep stated absolutely not... a cooking lesson must be reserved in advance... the lesson is 1.5 - 2 hours. I told her the card is useless as I don't have 1.5 - 2 hours to spare for a cooking class and we might as well cancel the reservation. (The gift card was one factor in making the decision to reserve dinner at Benihana and drive over Ben Franklin, otherwise we would go somewhere in Philadelphia for dinner.) She offered to get a manager to see about using the card for a regular ""non"" Be the Chef dinner. After waiting on hold for approx. 10 minutes, a manager finally became available to answer my call. She stated we can use the card as long as there is enough to cover the bill; as it doesn't not expire, regardless of it being a ""Be the Chef"" card. I reinstated, we ""can in fact""? we use it tonight's ""Regular"" ""Non Be the Chef"" dinner. Management said, YES, no problem.

We get there. My reservation is not in the system. My name not logged anywhere. We were however seated promptly. 

Our dinner was okay. No complaints about the Chef or assistant... they both offered good service. 

I presented the gift card for payment. It was not accepted. I stated management said it would be okay for tonight's regular non ""Be the Chef"" dinner.  Our Chefs assistant asked if we spoke to a women with an heavy Asian accent & if so she's not a manager.

The manager on duty, Jordan Junt, stated there's no way to process a ""Be the Chef"" card for a regular dinner... as the system would not allow it to process & the cooking class is 30-45 minutes opposed to 1.5-2 hours.

 At the end of the day, the $210.00 gift card was not applied toward our $167.56 dinner. The manager on duty was firm in stating the card cannot be processed and didn't do or say much to ease the tension of management misrepresentation. In which, she did have a heavy Asian accent; So, I cannot be certain that I actually spoke to management... which is a whole other issue.  

Also, the person who gave us the gift card said we can use the""Be the Chef"" card for regular dinners. So we wouldn't have to necessary take the cooking class. I wonder if the gift was misrepresented when purchased as well.  


ISSUES:

1. Reservation initially had wrong party # than was (deleted) after calling to update.

2. Reps/Management should provide patrons correct information. (Is cooking class 1.5-2 hours or 30-45 min... can a ""Be the Chef"" gift card be used for regular dinners as well)

3. Reps/Management should not misrepresent themselves or services offered. (Did a manager confirm the card could be used or did I speak with a rep who acted as management?) 

4. Managers on duty should show concern for customer dissatisfaction. 


(Tried to be fair by rating a 2.....   0 Star for Management, 3 Food,Chef, Assistant. Overall Okay but had and expected better. Will not go out of my way to go there, nothing special. I'll  probably sell my gift card at a deep discount)

Update:
After seeing my review. Corporate contacted me and provided a full refund and a new ""regular"" gift card.",2,"bad"
