A single word of unknown French origin. Much like the food, usually also of unknown origin. 

But we alllll go. You die hard foodie snobs out there, admit it. We all go, we all secretly love it and we all shrink at the notion that...GASP...we may actually enjoy them. We walk in like puffed up angry little birdies ready to shred them in our yelp reviews, riddled with low expectations and a keyboard trigger finger. SEEK AND DESTROY. 

I've figured out a trick to Buffet dining. NO expectations.

Which is probably why I liked Noburu so much. 

Now, there's a trick to Buffet dining that some folks just don't get. Go...when they open. For Noboru, 5pm is the golden hour. It's not quite busy yet, everyone's happy to see you, and the Chef's are just laying out the wall of sushi. 

If I were to compare Noboru to your average Center City shi shi sushi joint, of course it'd fail. However, comparing it to literally every single other sushi/mixed asian buffet I've ever been to (which is a lot, I'm quite fat.) It's the best. 

Is it pricey? Yes. I want my sushi to be expensive. Good sushi is expensive. You may pay 25 bucks a head for dinner, but you'll easily chow down 40 bucks worth of food.  

The service both times I went was exceptional. Very nice waiters, very attentive. Drinks always full. plates always removed. It's also incredibly clean. 

The sushi bar is their main feature, and I've tried all of it. 90% of it is good. The cooked food is your average Asian buffet fair with less grease, and a bit more flavor. They also have a rather wonderful little salad station. (Try the squid and edamame. YUM.)

They offer ice cream and plain tart yogurt for dessert with finger cakes and tiny little cookies. Cute cookies. Come on!

They also have dishes of the day. With our Sushi, we ordered the new york strip steak which..in all honesty...was pretty crap. BUT. Everything else was great. 

My point is, enjoy places like this for what they are, and don't condemn them for what they're not. If you walk in expecting a run of the mill buffet, you'll be surprised and you will enjoy yourself. 

If you walk in like you're Wolfgang Puck at a Golden Corral, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1,"good"
"3","Before I even get to the sushi, let me say they have Soon Du Bu (Korean Tofu Soup) and Hwe Dup Bap, two of my all time favorite asian dishes. I have never seen these at a buffet before, and I have to say it's like going to a bar and Springsteen just happens to be playing an impromptu set that night. 

Previous reviews didn't let me picture this place before I went, so I'll let you know that it is a newer constructed restaurant with high ceilings and a spacious feel. It is clean, clean, clean.

I knew to ask about the Soon Du Bu, so as soon as I was shown to my table I asked the server about it. She showed me where the soups were. There are several in cast iron pots ready to be heated. My server said she would bring it to my table when it was prepared.  

In the meantime, I grabbed a plate and filled it with one piece of each roll that intrigued me. This method usually yields a 15% YUM!, 50% pretty good, 30% meh, and 5% nah ratio at any given sushi buffet for me. On the day I went (Tuesday @ lunchtime around 12:30) the sushi was 25%YUM!, 65% pretty good and 10%meh. This could have been helped by the fact that the ginger, wasabi and soy sauce were better than what I've usually found at a sushi buffet. 

My the time I returned to my table with my first round of sushi, the soup was there. The service was terrific. The Soon Du Bu was just OK (Jong Ka Jib Soft Tofu Restaurant is still the very best) and the Hwe Dup Bap was great. Just remember to put the ""Korean Chili sauce"" and some rice on it then mix it up.

In summation, let me say that this place is just about perfect for what it is: an Asian buffet with a strong emphasis on sushi. You could eat just the sushi, but you'd be missing out on the other good dishes here.  I preferred Noboru over my last few visits to Minado. If you're looking for pure quality, there is no substitute for places like Bluefin. But if you're in the mood for a big meal with a lot of variety come here.",2,"good"
"4","Noboru is the relatively new all you can eat sushi bar in Montgomeryville, back in the same shopping area as LA Fitness, Texas Roadhouse, Baja Fresh and at the back Costco. 

While I had eaten here right around the time the sushi bar had opened, it had been some time, and I went on a relatively quiet Thursday night. Prices for that night are 21.95 plus drinks. The buffet does serve beer, but I decided to stick with just hot tea and water. 

Other posters had complained about variety of sushi, but I overall thought the selection was acceptable. You had everything from tuna, mackerel, salmon, surf clam, squid, eel, sweet shrimp. I actually thought the maki selection was very poor, compared to other sushi bars. My other complaint about the sushi is it was poorly made, with seawad falling apart, and the sushi overall lacking that beauty that adds to the enjoyment of eating sushi. Frankly I have seen better at the supermarket.

The variety of other things to eat is pretty impressive. Again, comparing to other sushi bars I have eaten at, there are fewer salads and hot entrees, but instead they do have soba noodles, shabu shabu, habacchi and hot pots available. That variety is pretty impressive.  None o the othe salads or entrees I had were memorable. You seemed to have the same types of flavors being glopped onto the dishes.. sesame, spice and shoyu. There is certainly a wider spectrum of flavors that could be added to dishes. My other complaint which is the same at any buffet I have ever eaten at, is the temperature of the food. The hot tables do not keep things hot enough, but are able to dry things out. A chicken gyoza I had resembled a leather football, and I wondered if I would break a tooth eating it.

On a positive note, the service was friendly and attentive. The one thing I would say is they need to tell folks more about how some of the special dishes work such as the soba or shabu shabu. I was stopped by one caucasian diner, asking me whether everything was included. 

For the price Noboru is an acceptable place to catch a quick bite of sushi if you dont want to go to supermarket. It is by no means a substitute for some of the better sushi bars in the area, including Ooka or Blue Fin.",1,"bad"
"5","Giving Noboru 2 stars is my way of being generous. 

I went for dinner over the weekend with some friends, and we were very disappointed. Considering the price for dinner, we all had expected a lot more.

At first glance, it appears as though there is a lot of sushi. However, after a closer look, we realized there actually was about 5 different types of sushi all with slight variations. For example, there was a shrimp roll, shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp tempura, shrimp tempura ""sandwich"", and shrimp tempura with a special sauce. I'm sorry, but that is not a good selection!

After we ate some sushi we decided to try some of their other dishes as well. The sesame chicken was pretty good if it was fresh, if it sat out for more than 15 minutes it would dry out and become hard to chew. Also, the fried rice was really bland and had a awkward texture. 

I know people go to Noboru for the dinner, but not the dessert, but since they had dessert we had to try it. On Noboru's website and Facebook page they advertise chocolate covered strawberries and even crepes! We saw nothing of the sort. There were miniature cookies which gave one of my friends and I a laugh because they were advertised as ""homemade"", when they clearly came from the nearest Acme. They also offered 3 small pieces of jello in a bowl, some fruit, mini cakes, mini brownies, vanilla soft serve ice cream and tart frozen yogurt (which, as a major fro yo fan, I was very disappointed in).  The only dessert item that my table semi-enjoyed were the brownies. 

Finally, I do have to say their cold veggies were delicious! I read some reviews prior to going, and one reviewer mentioned how great the asparagus was. I'm so glad I read their review and made sure to try the asparagus, because it was by far my favorite item there! My only suggestion would be that, while good cold, it should be served warm. I had one piece that was under a heat lamp and was so warm and delicious!

Overall I would say, avoid Noboru unless you really like shrimp and overpaying for food. It may have been the cleanest buffet I have ever been to, but no matter how clean a place is, if the food is not good then it is not worth it!",2,"bad"
