"2","We saw this new restaurant recommended on a local township page decided to give it a try for a Friday night takeout and we are SO glad we did! This will be our go-to place for Sushi from now on!

We ordered a couple of hot appetizers - pork gyoza, shrimp & vegetable tempura - and both were delicious, hot, crispy and clearly homemade.

My husband ordered the seafood soup which he raves about - it's a little spendy but it's a full quart size and they do not skimp on the seafood. 

We got the following sushi rolls - tuna & avocado, salmon & avocado, sunshine roll and avocado roll. All were absolutely delicious, fresh and tasty and very generous with ingredients. 

The only thing I'm not sure I would get again is the sashimi appetizer, which was fresh and tasty and very generous with the sashimi, but was an unusual presentation, almost tossed together like a salad with fish, radish and avocado. Again, it was definitely a nice appetizer and well-prepared, just a little unexpected.

I cannot recommend Emoji highly enough - everything we got was top quality and I can't wait to order again!",1,"good"
"3","I've been eagerly awaiting Emoji's opening for a while now, as I drive down Old York Road every day to take my daughter to school! 

We decided to stop in for dinner tonight, and I am so glad that we did.

First of all, the place is spotless. Yes, it's new, but you can tell they keep up with cleaning. They were wiping down menus, and spraying tables. The decor is also really cute :) 

The service was wonderful and incredibly friendly. I believe our waitress's name was Annie and she was very helpful, and gave good recommendations. 

We started with the soup and salad that came with our meals, and we also got complimentary edamame. The edamame and salad were great! I didn't love the miso soup but it was fine!

The tuna pizza was absolutely delicious. They didn't skimp on the tuna and it wasn't slathered in sauce. 

My sushi was great. The California roll was good and the sushi I had with my sushi regular meal was fresh and tasty. 

My husband ordered the lobster hibachi meal and added steak. He absolutely loved it. I tried some lobster and it was cooked really nicely. 

I'm really excited that another great place has opened in the Willow Grove/Abington area. Definitely check it out!",2,"good"
