"2","I was curious to try this Bluefin since I had been to the other related restaurants (original Bluefin and distant cousin Woojung that took over the 1st original Bluefin location).  

Like the others, the quality of the sushi does not disappoint.  Really fresh and well presented.  Ambiance wise, it's very classy, but not ostentatious.  It's an open dining space but booths have dividers to maintain some privacy.  There's enough light to keep it intimate, but not to the extent you can't see anything. Overall a very nice space (but be aware it's on the ground floor of an office complex, not a stand alone restaurant).

I really appreciated our server Jin, who explained which rolls were which once they came out.  There's so much overlap that I tend to forget exactly what we ordered and then can't recall for the next time.  We got the Tropic, Manayunk , New Rainbow, Oyster Mushroom, Boathouse.  The Manayunk was probably my favorite.  I was expecting to like the Oyster Mushroom the best, but I think Bluefin's version is better.  

I know this is an odd thing to note, but the bathroom fixtures were really unique and something I hadn't seen before.  They were Dyson and had the hand dryers built in with the faucet.  Very slick and contemporary.  Throughout the night I noticed managers making their rounds so it gives me the impression that service and customer experience is a priority for them.

All in all, the restaurant is great, but due to our location, I have a preference for the others.",1,"good"
"3","I was at Target this morning and craving sushi, so I looked up on Yelp what was nearby and saw B2 Bluefin was across the street. Had a little trouble finding it because it's in an office building (but they do have B2-designated parking spots near the entrance that you only see after you've driven around the parking lot looking for a space), but once I was parked it was a fabulous experience.

I was there for lunch so I can't speak to the dinner experience. It has a light and modern interior that is pretty swanky and probably fun for a Friday night dinner but a little overkill for Tuesday lunch. Since I was alone, the hostess asked if I'd like to sit at the sushi bar. She said the chefs are really friendly and fun to talk to. So I said sure. 

I sat down and immediately the four sushi chefs behind the counter were smiling and asking how I was. We started to chat it up and an hour later--long after I had finished my meal--we were still talking. We shared food photos, they talked about other restaurants where they had worked, we discussed the proper or traditional way to eat sushi, and I asked lots of questions about what they were preparing and what they do with the leftover fish that isn't sold that day. They joked that I must be planning to open my own sushi restaurant (I'm not). 

One glance at the menu and I realized I was not in a grab-and-go $8 sushi roll joint. Their lunch specials range from $16-25, but it was worth it. I had their Boathouse lunch special ($25) that includes the special Boathouse roll (all their rolls are Philly-themed names), a bowl of miso soup, and chef's choice of six pieces of sushi. It was plenty of food. 

While they were making my order, one of the chefs, Paul (yes, I learned their names, after all we were practically exchanging phone numbers by the end of lunch) slid me a beautifully prepared carpaccio plate with four thin pieces of fish that I had not ordered but gratefully accepted. It was delicious. 

The Boathouse plate was a lot of food for one person for lunch, and it was very nicely presented. The salmon sushi was especially fresh and good and practically melted in my mouth, and the Boathouse roll was perfect, with a little bit of crunchy goodness. 

This is not a cheap lunch but it was excellent. The service was fantastic, the sushi was among the best I've had in this area (Mt Fuji is our go-to), and I will definitely be back with my husband for a date night. I would take the entire family there but it's too pricey for a family dinner out unless it's a special occasion.",2,"good"
