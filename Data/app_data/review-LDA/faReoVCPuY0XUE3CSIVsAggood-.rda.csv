"2","Sushi in Affton? I wasn't thinking that would be a good thing, but I decided to take the plunge! I like seeing new businesses pop up in my neighborhood, so I wanted to give them a chance. So glad I did! Wow! Talk about exceeding my expectations! 

Sushi Hana has a small window front on Gravois Ave. and a small parking lot located in front of the business. You could easily drive past it, but look for the lime green paint on the building. Once you enter, you are greeted immediately by friendly staff that take you to your seat. Near the front entrance is a small sushi bar. If you are in a hurry this is probably not the place to go. This sushi chef is a true artist and takes his time creating decadent rolls. Trust me, they are worth the wait! There are a few seats at the sushi bar if you want a front row seat to the creative process. Attention to detail is definitely the theme here even down to the dining area and decorative table settings. The restaurant is very clean with several booths and tables. There is also one long table for larger groups. 

Now onto the food! The sushi is fresh, flavorful and melts in your mouth. The rice texture is perfect. They have a wide array of sushi choices all with delicious combinations and several specialty rolls. If sushi is not your thing they also have several equally amazing alternatives on their menu. The one I have tried twice and highly recommend is the bibimbap. Wow, so delicious! This is in a very large bowl, usually plenty to take home and have for a second meal. It is topped with a large fried egg and amazing, spicy sauce. You can tell they put a lot of passion into their food. 

There is a small selection of beer, wine, and sake. You can also order bottles of wine. Another thing to mention is the pricing. You get exceptional food with attention to detail and large portions for a reasonable price. If you are looking for high quality sushi in a place you wouldn't expect, check out Sushi Hana!",1,"good"
"3","The best sushi restaurant in St. Louis is in Affton. Yeah, I'm surprised too, but there's no sense burying the lead. Sushi Hana is the most authentic, flavorful, friendly, welcome addition to the St. Louis food scene in forever. Great news for Afftonites like me, because I usually have to burn some gas or brave some traffic to get to great food. No more. Hallelujah!

My wife and I saw a couple of stellar reviews of this new, tiny sushi place at 8809 Gravois Rd, and we were hopeful but dubious. I'm a 30-year sushi devotee and she's spent a good deal of time in Japan, so we usually end up hitting Bob's Seafood and making our own. But we figured we'd give it a chance, so we went there for lunch. An hour later, we couldn't stop smiling, and couldn't believe our fantastic luck. God has finally smiled upon Affton. 

We were delighted to have the chef greet us in Japanese, and gaining even more hope when the woman who brought our drinks (Sapporo, of course) spoke only Japanese, with just enough English to be polite. Despite their terrific-seeming lunch specials, we ordered off the a la carte menu: Salmon Avocado Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and several pieces of Nigiri, including Albacore (Shiromaguro), BBQ Eel (unagi), Fatty Tuna (toro), and Squid (Ika). We were welcomed with complimentary and delicious miso soup, which included tofu, mushrooms, and just the right amount of seaweed and miso. Things were looking bright. 

Our order came arrayed on a lovely wooden bridge, and again included a couple of complimentary items from the chef, including the most delicious albacore I've ever had. From item to item we went, each dish more delicious than the last. By the time we'd tasted everything, we couldn't believe what was happening. We simultaneously agreed: This is the best sushi we've ever had in St. Louis, hands down. Tokyo on Lindbergh, not even close. Nobu, no way. In fact neither of us can think even now of better sushi we've had, ever, anywhere (excluding her time in Japan). This sushi barely wanted a touch a soy sauce, so much exciting flavor did each piece boast (though their wasabi and ginger were delightful even in tiny amounts). 

What I most want to get across here is how every bite, EVERY item, was so, so flavorful. Hana Sushi's chef uses a combination of the choicest ingredients and some personal slicey-dicey magic to create, if I haven't mentioned this, THE BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD. I'm hesitant to write this review, because I plan to go back a few times a week and don't like to wait (which on this visit we didn't; our order was ready shortly after our soup was finished). But good news must be shared. 

A couple of caveats to those raised on Missouri sushi: This isn't sushi with flavored mayo sprayed across it, and the portions aren't gas-station-sized. This is the real thing, with the best ingredients. Even the sesame seeds on the Spicy Tuna Roll were bursting with that delicious sesame flavor. The good news is that by the time my wife and I left, we couldn't stop smiling, were feeling that dreamy feel that comes with an amazing meal, and we couldn't imagine eating again today, all of which came to $43, including 2 large Sapporo beers at $7 each. 

Sushi Hana has only been there for two weeks. My advice is to get there immediately, as many times as possible, before Ian Froeb at the P-D and the RFT Best of St. Louis make it impossible to get a table.",2,"good"
