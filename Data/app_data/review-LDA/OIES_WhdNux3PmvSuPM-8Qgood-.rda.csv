"2","This is some of THE best sushi I've had in Tampa, the prices are very reasonable, and it's right in our neck of the woods!  Fish and seafood are the stars here and it is all super fresh.  We started with the shrimp tempura appetizer.  It include two fresh, sweet shrimp in wonderfully light batter and some fresh veggies.  Tempura can easily be greasy or too heavy but this was absolute perfection!

For our sushi selection, we tried to stick with some simpler rolls, as these are usually a very good measure of the chef's skill and the freshness of the fish.  The Bagel roll is one of our standard orders - smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallion.  The smoked salmon pieces were huge and the salmon itself was outstanding.  We also sampled the Florida roll - tuna, cucumber, scallion, mayo with citrus tobiko on the outside of the roll.  The tuna was also a huge portion and very fresh.  The veg inclusions were a nice balance to the richness of the fish, but we couldn't taste/didn't notice the citrus tobiko at all.  Rounding out the simpler rolls, we did the Key West roll - spicy conch, avocado, roe, scallion and cucumber.  This was our least favorite - mostly because we suddenly remembered why we prefer conch in fritter form only.  The conch was good, though not at all spicy, but like all conch - there were very chewy spots.  Eh, not quite our thing but worth a shot.

The only ""premium roll"" we got was the Snow White - house made slightly spicy crab salad (yes, crab with a 'C'), avacado and tempura tips on top.  The crab salad was so outstanding, we ended up scraping the tempura crunchies off the top of most of the rolls as the bread taste only distracted from the sweet, just-enough-spicy crab.  This was outstanding and we are thinking of asking for a custom roll of just the 'crab special' and cucumber on our next visit.

Great, quiet atmosphere, good service and an easy to find location.  Toki made our tummies very happy and we spent the whole drive home plotting when we can next return.  My absolute #1 pick for sushi in Tampa!",1,"good"
"3","My Yelp friends Christy T., and her fianc√©, David H. (from Orlando) joined me for a superlative-laden sushi banquet at Toki Sushi on N. Dale Mabry in Carrollwood this past weekend.

The three of us are sushi fanatics -- we like our sushi pure, and not rolled up with a bunch of gunk inside and dripping with sickly sweet sauces. As a result we had been plotting an evening at a local sushi house to test the skills of the resident sushi master. I have been a loyal client of Toki Sushi for over ten years, and have become good friends with head chef, Chris, who was classically trained in Japan, and who brought his skills to the US about 40 years ago. With Chris's help we planned an evening of Omakase delights for the three of us to enjoy.

At the appointed time, I arrived and said ""Konichiwa, Itamae"" to Chris, which is the formal way of greeting the sushi master, and showing respect for his craft. The concept of Omakase is basically saying ""Chef's choice"", or more correctly ""We are putting our trust in you to deliver the best possible meal for us"". Since Chris and I had arranged for the Omakase meal in advance, he was able to order some special treats and to arrange very elegant preparations for us to enjoy.

The Omakase meal is served as a series of small plates where the tastes, textures, and sensual delights flow smoothly from one dish to the next. Chris asked if there was anything that we didn't like, and then set about placing the courses in front of us one at a time. I've included photos for each course, but here are the descriptions:

#1 - Octopus and Shrimp miso salad

#2 - Tuna Tataki

#3 - Squid with yuzu tobiko and Squid with uni

#4 - Chutoro - Medium-fatty Tuna

#5 - Marinated Sea Bass

#6 - Seared Salmon Belly

#8 - Mackarel Roll

#9 - Uni and Firecracker (mixed with Octopus)

#10 - Giant Clam

#11 - Squid with wasabi tobiko and Albacore Tuna

#12 - Sushi handroll with Eel and sliced Avocado

12 courses of incredible deliciousness that we're still talking about. This was not an inexpensive meal - roughly $75 a piece, but if you truly love sushi then you owe it to yourself to try an Omakase meal sometime at the hands of a sushi master.

Chris entertained us with stories of his training in Japan, and we discussed techniques for cleaning and preparing the fish, as well as his amazing knife skills as he shaved wafer-thin slices of fish and rested them atop his carefully-crafted rice.

This was a spectacular evening with two great Yelp friends, and the wizardry of our chef.   Domo arigato, Itamae!",2,"good"
