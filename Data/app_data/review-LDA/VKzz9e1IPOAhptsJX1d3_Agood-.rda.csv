"2","the one element that allows Zushi Dozo to stand above and beyond the rest of the other ""cookie cutter"" sushi restaurants is the time/effort that Chef Jae puts into these beautiful works of edible art. Every other sushi restaurant whether it be a top notch or a simple sushi/sashimi place have gotten so far astray from the three key factors of sushi which are time/temperature/taste. Chef Jae has kept true to those philosophy all the while establishing a modern play on flavors for the American palate. It is with great pleasure I say that I will be returning to dine on the fresh taste and top quality products Chef Jae continuously presents to the diner. His charisma and charm also add to the overall experience and you really can't ask for more than that. 

Chef Jae THANK YOU for the great meal!!",1,"good"
"3","Not too far off the beaten path of I-295,... we found a tiny Sushi Bar niche'd into the back corner of an existing Korean BBQ establishment. Guided by GPS, we almost missed it, and after sitting in the parking lot double checking the address,... we walked into a near empty Korean BBQ only to be directed to the corner where the Sushi Bar was nestled. ​ We ordered the classics,... a little bit of everything. It was my niece' first time,... I wanted her to try the basics before taking the palate plunge of no return :-) ​ Overall a great place; atmosphere, high quality to a reasonable cost ratio,  great service and speed of delivery.  ​ Definitely plan on stopping by again on our next commute  :-)",2,"good"
