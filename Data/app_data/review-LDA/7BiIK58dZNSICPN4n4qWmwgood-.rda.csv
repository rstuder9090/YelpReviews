"2","I've been a customer here for a very long time now, and i love it. The sushi is very fresh. I went here after a while of not visiting, and it seemed as though they must have gotten new people to work. Sorry for the lengthy post, but i think this should clear some things up.


For one, they definitely got a new sushi chef. He's so much more friendly with the customers, and is fast! They also had a new server. Who was very sweet. Whenever she made a mistake she smiled and kindly explained that it was her first time serving. I think her name was Melissa or Michelle. I went back after a while and it seemed that she got the hang of everything.

I also read a comment down there where it said that there was an empty parking lot on friday night at 6pm. Well every time i go, its usually very busy around 7pm. Also, they switched locations. They used to be on West End and they moved to Brentwood. Not many people knew of the big switcharoo so that could be the misunderstanding.

I came here a few weeks ago, and ordered a soup and salad like i always do. Their miso soup is just pretty basic but there salad dressing is SO DELICIOUS. I dont know what they put in there but its creamy and amazing. I love their deep fried rolls (crazy is my favorite) but their special roll called the Spider roll is magnificent also.

This place is really amazing. And i suggest you give it a go. You'll be hooked.",1,"good"
"3","I'll come out and say it: having sushi in a land-locked state scares me.  Its hard to get something really fresh when its 8 hours to the nearest ocean.  And having been spoiled enough to work with, and dine with, dear Japanese friends, I can be picky.  But let's just call this place what it is: a good place for some decent sushi, located close to the 440 interchange where you can grab a meal on the way home.  They do takeout, FYI, which is very nice when you're in a rush.

There are some fun rolls on the menu, like their baked samarai roll (with red snapper) and their famous Shreveport orgasm roll (tempura shrimp, spicy tuna).  They do great bento boxes (my favorite would be the bulgogi).  The nigiri (traditional Japanese-style sushi with a piece of fish on top of rice) isn't my favorite in all honestly.  The have a great house salad with a delicious dressing and I love their simple yet soothing miso soup.

The service here is always warm and welcoming and like I said, you can't go wrong with takeout.  It's so nice to grab food on the way home after a long day.  I recommend this place for a quick yet relaxing mid-week meal or as a way to surprise your sweetie on the way home from work.",2,"good"
