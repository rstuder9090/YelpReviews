"2","I met a friend here for lunch and they have great lunch specials! Each lunch comes with a soup and a salad. I had sushi and my friend had teriyaki chicken and rice. I can honestly say we were both stuffed when we left!
The sushi for the lunch special is a more simple roll but it was delicious. They have a wide variety of ""fancy"" sushi rolls too, just not part of the lunch special.

There is inside and outside seating. We sat outside because it was still cool enough to do so. They also have a big awning so it is not in direct sun.

The server was very attentive and friendly.

One thing to know if you are using an ap to find it, the location is off. E-sushi is in the building in front of Publix. Your app will send you past the turn and you will probably have to make a u-turn to come back.

It is a little far from my work, but I would definitely come here again. I may also look at getting takeout.",1,"good"
"3","Why 4 stars? Because this is a nice dining option in an area not known for those.

This was another recently discovery when searching for newer businesses relatively near me that I bookmarked not too long ago. I used all of Thanksgiving week to go crazy and eat whatever I wanted with no restriction to give myself a break from trying to eat pretty healthy. This was my final meal before shutting it back down and returning to fat burning mode.

We enjoyed it overall, but this is what 4-star reviews were made for. The meal was nice, but nothing overwhelmed us. 

The Sweet Mango roll was just okay. I ordered it because it was a bit unique, but there's probably a reason mangos and fish don't mix. It wasn't weird or anything, but the flavors didn't exactly bring out the best in each other.

The Volcano Roll was messy but tasty. And the Lobster General Roll was enjoyable, but just a warning for those who don't like this sort of thing, the seaweed taste was a bit stronger in this one.

My wife ordered chicken teriyaki, which was fine. It came with a *ton* of chicken - I don't think she even ate half, despite me helping. The fried rice was the best part.

Next time I'm craving sushi, I'll probably opt for one of my favorite places nearby, but I'm happy for the people who live nearby in an area where good local restaurants are hard to come by.",2,"good"
"4","It doesn't matter how good the food is if the staff is treated like garbage.
We visited this establishment for the second time shortly after moving into town, thinking this could be our local favorite, but we will NEVER dine here again.
Having previously worked in the service industry, I full understand how challenging times are for restaurants and more importantly THEIR STAFF right now. Our server who shall remain nameless (due to fear of retribution by the owners), was absolutely amazing. She did her very best to answer our questions keep our drinks topped off, and make us feel welcome.
The owners on the other hand had different plans. 
Rather than jumping in and helping their already over extended staff, they chose to berate, hurry, and otherwise BULLY their staff into submission. Apparently, they are so abrasive another member of the service staff quit and walked out mid shift while we were there! 
Like I said, the food might be decent, but there is absolutely NO meal good enough to justify treating staff in an inhumane manner. We refuse to support business that treat their employees like trash, and you shouldn't either.",1,"bad"
"5","First time we went there we got the wrong sushi roll, and a huge hair in our hibachi. Decided to give it a second try tonight. 5 of the 6 of us got hibachi again. Chicken was so hard and dry with no flavor. Asked for sauce, 20 minutes later I had to get up to get our servicer. She told me she was ""busy."" Finally got our sauce, but by that time food was even more gross and cold. All 6 meals came out at different times. They ran out of sweet tea. We needed refills the entire time. My sushi roll came out wrong. I asked for a side of avocado that was supposed to go inside it, and she charged me extra for it. I also asked for a side of the rice vinegar that's supposed to go on the sushi roll. After everyone was done eating, I finally got my avocado and vinegar. I poured it on my roll... it was white vinegar, not rice vinegar. Almost $200 later, we stopped at Moes on the way home, and they stopped at McDonald's.",2,"bad"
