"2","I've had a lot of great burgers in Nashville, and this ranks high among them. I ordered the jalapeño burger and was not disappointed. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. The beef was fresh, juicy and well-seasoned. If I'm not mistaking, it tasted as if the buns were slightly buttered on the inside (?). Either way, they were amazing. As per the jalapeño, the spice level was mild, so it didn't overpower the burger at all.

My husband and I also ordered the hot chicken spring rolls, which were a nice (and tasty) nod to Nashville. The chicken inside the roll had a traditional hot chicken flavor and a very nice mayo dip to cool the spice. We will definitely be ordering these again.

I'm far more a fan of burgers than sushi, so I'm happy to have a place where friends can get their sushi fix and I'm not annoyed to tag along. 

Our server was speedy and pleasant, and I loved the decor and overall vibe. Can't wait to come back and try more! Next up: the Truck Stop and a spiked shake.",1,"good"
"3","I had very high expectations for Lucky Belly, as I'm a big fan of Two Ten Jack. I was quite entertained by the confusion I overheard from some college kids discussing the menu, ""It's japanese....burgers?"" 

The decor is super trendy, complete with servers in flannel shirts , faux graffiti, and a fireplace painted to look like a giant happy robot. The menu is, of all things, entertaining. Ever wanted to play Russian roulette with your sushi? Now you can.  They have a Dare Devil roll, in which ONE random piece is loaded with Habanero Bullseye sauce. 

My tuna burger was topped with pickled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and... Wasabi mayo. I got the mayo on the side because I don't handle spicy very well, but trust me when I say it's not hot at all, just delightful. I'm not big on fries, but the fries here are actually fantastic. The meal was wonderful. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with a jalapeño aioli and she really enjoyed her meal too and said she will be bringing more friends back soon. 

I also grabbed a side of eel nigiri because I wanted to try the sushi. Unfortunately, the sushi didn't quite measure up for me. The eel was just a little rubbery and dry and really light on the sauce. It's the only reason this isn't a five star review. 

Some might find the menu of Japanese inspired burgers, sushi, and spiked milkshakes confusing, but I personally found it delightful and am glad to have found this place!",2,"good"
