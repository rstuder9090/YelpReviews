"2","Cafe Square One is a hidden gem! I love to swing through on my lunch break for their enormous, affordable salads--full of protein and vibrantly colored veggies. They give plenty of dressing, too.

For breakfast, they offer huge bowls of oatmeal. Although I usually forego oatmeal while eating out (because I can make it at home), the sweet berries, mashed bananas throughout, and perfect texture makes Square One's oatmeal feel like a worthy takeout option. 

Pro-tip: Their rose latte is my favorite beverage--period. It's the kind of drink you sip slowly with your eyes closed.

The only reason I'm not giving this jawn five stars is the wait time: If you order at the counter, you've got a long wait ahead of you. Every. Single. Time. Even if you're planning to eat in the cafe, I recommend placing an online order ahead of time",1,"good"
"3","Oh God I love this place so much. Their wraps are absolutely massive and come with a side of loose tortilla chips, not the individual bags of chips that are available to purchase separately. They're also served up in a hard, clear plastic container instead of just wrapped up in paper.

I had the Chicken Club Wrap which did not stint at all on the chicken or avocado, two things that most places will try to go light on. It was amazing and incredibly filling, well worth $8.

For my second trip, a mere week later, I tried the Oriental Chicken Wrap which came again with lots of chicken and a good helping of almond flakes. The Asian sesame dressing paired well but did have the unfortunate side effect of dripping all over the place and making the 2nd half of my wrap a little soggier than I would've liked. Probably best to stick to creamier dressings in the future since the chipotle mayonnaise for the club wrap was no problem.

There's definitely an office-crowd lunch rush so try to get there before noon or after 1pm. It's a small operation and they're quick in processing the line of people for orders but, inevitably, slow down a little bit when it comes to rolling out the actual sandwiches/wraps.",2,"good"
"4","Seriously? Do not understand all the rave reviews, just attempted to eat the Chipotle Chicken Wrap that was swimming in inedible hot saucey mayo. Expected a little bit of smoky heat from the description, but this was ridiculous. And if you're going to give me bacon, don't give me bacon bits, that's just rude. Threw out more than half the sandwich, couldn't even pick through the darn thing, pissed I spent 9 bucks on it. And the soggy, stale tortilla chips and crappy pickle was just the cherry on top of a sad sundae of a lunch.",1,"bad"
"5","Stopped here for a quick breakfast and coffee last week. The person at the counter was on her cell phone on a personal call. I approached the counter twice and she didn't hang up the phone. I finally placed my order since my friend and I took her coats off and set her table with our coffees while we waited for my avocado toast. After waiting a very long time I went up to the other end of the counter where the food prep was to see what was taking so long. The guy pointed to a takeout bag with my food in it. He said he called me, but he didn't know my name, I didn't hear anybody call anyting, and the woman who took my order was literally right behind me and didn't call out to me either. And why would they put it in a takeout bag? I was very obviously dining in.
Also, very weird that the absolute only milk option for coffees was whole milk.
My avocado toast happened to be delicious even though it was cold by the time I found it. coffee was also good that I would have preferred to different milk. Service was terrible.",2,"bad"
