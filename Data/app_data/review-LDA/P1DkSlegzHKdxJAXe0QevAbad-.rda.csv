"2","My regular sushi place was closed (Monday) so I went with Kumo sight unseen. The reviews were good recently but not so good awhile back. I opted for pick up vs. delivery since it was a nice walk from my apartment. The online ordering experience (BeyondMenu) was fine, and I liked that you could pay online as well. When I arrived, I thought they were closed and I had lost my money! It looked dark, there was a gate over the door and overall, very uninviting. But the gated door opened and there was my meal, bagged up and ready to go. It was touch-less, which was good. Walking home, I had even lower expectations, considering the look and feel of the property. However, I was pleasantly surprised! I had 2 rolls, 5 pieces of sushi, and 1 special roll....and was VERY happy with all of them! For the affordable (low!) price and convenient location, I would definitely recommend! I would really suggest sprucing up the property, though, as I am SURE it would result in better business, especially since it is a busy food traffic area!",1,"good"
"3","Delectable sushi! This is my second time ordering from Kumo and once again I am extremely impressed. The UFO with eel sauce is my absolute favorite. Delivery is extremely fast and comes with healthy portions of ginger and AUTHENTIC wasabi. Each roll has eight beautifully succulent pieces. This time I also ordered both the fried and steamed shumai, a shrimp shumai showdown was in order. The steamed shrimp shumai had a a lot of subtle flavors that were lost in the fried shrimp shumai. Crunchy and packed with shrimp, the fried shrimp shumai was also tasty. 

Overall I have had nothing but positive experiences with this restaurant. Amazing sushi, aggressively priced and fast delivery. What else could you want?",2,"good"
"4","I'm am completely disappointed with this restaurant.  We ordered from here once before and enjoyed the food.  We moved since our last order (only 3 blocks further west in west philly) and now they refuse to deliver to us.  Mizu, which is further east, still delivers to us.  I can only imagine that this restaurant drew this boundary (we are on the ""other side of the tracks"") based on racist assumptions about folks who live outside of university city.  I refuse to support a restaurant that limits its clientele by these types of stereotypes.  I hope others who read this review who do not support racists business practices will stop purchasing their sushi from a restaurant that is clearly doing just this.  I am so disgusted and disappointed.  Shame on you Kumo!!",1,"bad"
"5","Eat somewhere else, this place was terrible! We took a chance since the ratings are so high, but like another reviewer said college students apparently know nothing about good sushi. 

The miso soup tasted like salt water and had no visible tofu. We ordered one roll with ""crunch,"" and instead of adding it to the roll they give you a little container to I guess dip your sushi? My ""spicy girl"" roll was hardly spicy and my fish was grainy/mealy, suggesting it was poorly cut. The rolls were poorly constructed and fell apart immediately. Overall it wasn't flavorful, even the rice with was bland.

Maybe things will get better, but I get the feeling they are cutting more corners than sushi.",2,"bad"
