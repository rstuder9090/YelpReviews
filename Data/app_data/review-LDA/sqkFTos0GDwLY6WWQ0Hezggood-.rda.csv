"2","Although my take-out meal hit a few bumps in the road, I can really see a lot of potential in this place.  It's a bright and cheery little spot with sushi bar and small table seating, situated in a lonely stretch between Walnut and Locust.  

I ordered the 3-roll special for $10.95 + tax and got the beach spicy roll, New York roll (salmon, tuna, and apple - YUM!), and eel avocado roll.  All three were loaded with fish.  Although I expected pre-diced fish drenched in spicy sauce for my spicy roll, I was pleasantly surprised that all three rolls were composed of whole pieces of fish, showcasing its freshness and quality.  There was a lot of fish in each roll with just the right proportion of rice.  The 6-piece rolls were each very thick - 6 piece by birth, but definitely 8-piece in spirit.  

The bumps I encountered were the lack of wasabi and pickled ginger in my take-out bag.  Definitely check on that before you leave the restaurant!  The take-out tray honestly couldn't fit anything else besides the rolls, so maybe that's a good excuse for why they forgot to add the condiments.  In any case, I'm sure the kinks of a brand new place will be worked out soon.  

I can't wait to try their party trays, sushi specials, and specialty rolls.  Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and from what I ate tonight, fresh and delicious.  They also appear to have a 10% discount for lunch, so don't miss out!  One of the best deals on sushi so far.",1,"good"
"3","FINALLY!!! I finally found a replacement sushi spot for my beloved Vic's, which is no longer in my top 5 (or even top 10 for that matter -- see my review on Vic's for details). 

Being a stone's throw from my apartment, I noticed Yamaki was opening a few weeks ago and I stopped in to get a menu. The owner is super friendly and invited me in to dine, but I was on my way to something else and promised I'd be back. 

This past Saturday, I was starving and decided to dine in. It's a cute little place - more spacious than Vic's, decked out in typical Asian decorations (I'm Asian so I'm allowed to say these types of things haha) and playing cheesy B101-esque music from an old school stereo system. 

The owner greeted us and let us choose our seats. We sat at the sushi bar to watch the two sushi chefs prepare our dinner. After much deliberation, we ended up ordering: miso soup, seaweed salad, the 3 rolls for $10.95 special, and 2 specialty rolls. 

Much to our delight, the miso soup & seaweed salad portions are MASSIVE. The rolls all came out on one giant plate shortly thereafter. Yellowtail scallion, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna were fresh and delicious, with a good ratio of rice to filling (i.e.: not too much rice). 

The specialty rolls were my favorite, Yellow Dragon was filled with chunks of super fresh fish and topped with the thinnest slices of mango so it did not overpower the roll. Aki Roll was equally tasty, filled with more fresh fish and topped with some sort of eel-like sauce. 

We topped off our meal with hot tea and paid only $35 for the entire feast.  Note, it's a BYOB.

It's a shame that it's located on an odd block of 20th Street and is easy to miss. I normally hate to tell people about my little gems, but I want this place to thrive & be my go-to sushi spot -- so hurry up & go!",2,"good"
