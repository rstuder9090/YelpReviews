"2","I worked in Glenside a few years ago and ordered some Chinese from them, before I got into sushi, and was always impressed with their food. Recently I've been able to dive more into the sushi scene and have had a hard time finding good local places. Queen is pretty close to home for me and with a big banner boasting ""$20 ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI TUESDAYS"" I had to give it a shot.

The first time I went was with my friend Adam and we got a lovely variety, I absolutely enjoyed my Volcano roll and Spider roll as well as some of Adam's Hamachi roll. For $20, their all you can eat sushi is a great deal considering how much some of the special rolls can cost. And for a sushi novice like myself, its a great chance to open up and try some more things you're not quite familiar with. This past Tuesday I met up for dinner with another friend of mine who's much more well versed in sushi and he said it was just alright, but I still think it was delicious.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the service could stand some improvement, though each time I was there I've never had a problem, they've been very attentive when my drink was getting low and if the plates were becoming empty. They're still absolutely worth checking out!",1,"good"
"3","Queen Sushi has been one of my favorites for years

Food: More times than none, I come for the lunch special. During the week, between 11-3, you can get a Chinese lunch special for less than 6$. Included in the lunch special: 1 main entree, white rice or pork fried rice, soup or an egg roll or a soda. Their sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken are my favorites. Another great special at QS is their All-You-Can-Eat sushi option on Tuesdays. This includes any sushi roll from the menu made to order. 

5/5

Service: The employees are very nice and fast. If you ordered pick-up they are quickly getting you in and out with a smile. If you want to sit down they are welcoming and attentive. Ive never had a bad experience with any of the staff at QS. 

5/5

Location: Inside is very authentic with traditional Chinese decor. The atmosphere is very warm and comforting and suites the needs of a quick lunch or a proper dinner. As any location in Keswick Village, parking isn't the best. Especially if there is a show at the Keswick Theatre. 

4/5

"4","Only signed up for yelp to share the absolutely terrible experience I had here - I am not one to knock people down but I have never been treated so poorly before and even tried to speak to them in person then call to share my experience and instead I was treated even worse. 

So here goes...

My husband, daughter, and I came here for dinner this evening and were the ONLY people in the restaurant. First time, and we were given attitude from the very start as the waitress took our order. Turns out the waitress was also the manager as well as the owner. You would think that the owner of a restaurant would want customers to have a positive experience and have basic customer service skills. The food was okay but she never came to check on us and forgot my daughter's meal altogether. All the staff was in the back, while we were waiting for someone to come out so we could let them know they forgot our daughter's food and we were waiting on the check. We got the sushi chef's attention who was sitting crouched behind the sushi bar on his phone. (Which I can imagine is some sort of health code violation). Finally, he got the waitress/manager/owner and I explained to her we have never had such terrible service especially being as we were the only people in the restaurant. She had no concern whatsoever, nor was she in the least bit apologetic. I noticed this and said that It didn't seem as though she cared. Her response was ""yeah I don't have time to care"". I was taken aback by the blatant lack of concern. I called later to speak with a manager to share the experience I had in case it was not a typical thing. I got the same person on the phone who shared that she was the manager as well as the owner. She continued with her non-giving-a-s#it and was very disrespectful so here I am on Yelp trying to ease my own what-the-fu#k-just-happened. Oh also we ordered my daughter pizza from silver moon pizza in Roslyn. She loved it, no complaints there.",1,"bad"
"5","I'm always getting menus from Chinese restaurants and pizzerias, but when you have your standbys, it's not easy for a new place to catch your eye. The menu for Queen came this week, and I wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection. They have the usual veggie and bean curd (a.k.a. tofu) entrees, but they also have mock chicken, beef, and duck. We actually ordered carryout the same day I read the menu - I was excited!

The food was okay, but I have to admit, it was disappointing. Part of me wants to try another few dishes, but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable. 

First up - moo shu vegetables. I usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce, and this had the bonus of including broccoli, baby corn, and mushrooms. But the pancakes were dry, stuck together, and inedible. The corn tasted like a can. Not great.

Next, vegetarian ""beef"" with mixed vegetables. The beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan, where the stuff still tastes like flour. The sauce was good, but the dish was unremarkable. 

Finally, we ordered one of the Chef's Specialties - bean curd with general tso's sauce. The silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky, sugary sauce, and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside. Very disappointing - no spice, no heat, and just sugar and fat for appeal. 

The two star rating means I've had better. My absolute favorite is Wild Ginger in Huntingdon Valley, and I also prefer China Garden Inn in Willow Grove. I was hoping for a good take out place closer to home, but this isn't it.",2,"bad"
