"2","Looking for a great budget omakase in Philadelphia? Look no further than DK Sushi in the Franklin's Table Food Hall on the Penn campus! For just $35, the meal changes slightly every day and allows the different chefs assigned to particular days to express their vision and creativity. My dinner companion, Ken, was hesitant at first on trying all the different fishes, but was open-minded enough to dive right in. Our chef, Zion, started our meals with two tried and true omakase courses - tuna tartare and hamachi ceviché - along with a special miso soup with shrimp tempura. From there, our chef churned out plates of traditional sushi, two or three pieces at a time. The sea urchin and scallops were delightful, light, and refreshing. The toro, really a chu-toro, and yellowtail toro had good flavors. I prefer fatty cuts of fish over lean cuts. The Kobe and ikura were the chef's play on ""surf and turf"" and were melt in your mouth good and squishy bubbles of salty delight! The toro scallion roll almost served as a palate cleanser for the intense flavors of the final dish, a miso foi gras mini hand roll and eel sushi. I could eat ten of the foie gras sushi! The incredible thing about all of the sushi is the sushi rice was warm and perfectly seasoned. Warm rice is the only way to eat sushi! Big kudos to Chef Zion for using the available ingredients to craft a very nice omakase meal.",1,"good"
"3","This Double Knot sushi satellite eatery is located in the new and posh Franklin Hall ""food court"". I went with a coworker over lunch to try it out. Though there was a small line, it went by quickly. The menu has a lot of sushi options but the ""chef's box"" seemed like the best deal. $16 for 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, salmon over rice, edamame, and 2 rolls. Definitely a splurge for lunch but I decided to treat myself.

The meal is packed neatly in a cute little DK box. All the sides (wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, a spicy sauce) are in their own labeled containers. VERY aesthetically pleasing, not very environmentally friendly. 

This is what really annoyed me: for that giant box of $16 sushi, you get one little pea size amount of wasabi (pictured). Granted, I am a wasabi fiend but how can they possibly think that small amount is enough for all that sushi? I kindly asked for more wasabi and was told it would be a 50 cent charge by the manager. I can *maybe* understand if I ordered one roll or a couple pieces of sashimi but that was just annoying and unacceptable. 

The sushi itself was unbelievable. The fish was so fresh and abundant and the rice was incredible. Definitely way too much food for one person but would be perfect to split with someone. My favorite was the salmon over rice with spicy sauce! 

Though I'll never spend $16 on a lunch again, would definitely come back and order salmon over rice on its own. Everything else was similarly pricey but worth a ""once in a while"" lunch time splurge for high quality sushi.",2,"good"
