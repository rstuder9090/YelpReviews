"2","Born and raised in Hawaii, I was spoiled with quality fish... So when it comes to sushi, I need quality to satisfy my taste buds... and quantity to satisfy my stomach... We come to Reno annually for my sons AAU basketball tournament and we normally go to Kokopelli's inside Silver Legacy. This time around, I wanted to try out something different and since we were staying at the Peppermill (which is only a couple blocks away), Sushi Pier 2 was gonna be our AYCE sushi spot for this trip... and after our experience, I'm sure for many more to come. AYCE sushi is very reasonably priced at $16.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner. I guarantee you, my teenage son and I ate probably $100 worth of sushi each!  

Ok, for starters, the place is pretty big. Big enough that it has 2 sushi bars, one in the middle/left of the restaurant and one in the back. There's also a regular bar in the front of the restaurant as well. It looked like they accommodated a party of 35-40 sitting next to us, which was good to know. It's decorated nicely, contemporary but not overkill... flat screen TVs are almost everywhere you look, which is good for sports fans! 

I read previous reviews complaining about their slow service but after eating there, I realized that the ""slow"" service isn't necessarily because of lack of professionalism or attentiveness but more or less due to the fact that they're BUSY! Again, there was a party of 35-40 next to us, along with your usual parties of 4, 6, 8, etc... and the restaurant was pretty full all the way until closing! I'd also like to add that my wife is super picky and needs all kinds of customizations when she orders food (smdh)... Good news was that our server (I think he may have been the owner) had no problem taking stuff out and/or adding stuff in to any of the rolls she ordered! (HUGE plus... you have no idea)

OK. Now to the sushi... everything we ordered came pretty fast! My younger son ordered the chicken teriyaki /shrimp tempura combo and that was at our table within 10 minutes. Every time we handed our waiter the AYCE sushi order form, our rolls were out within 5-10min max. I can't remember all the names of the rolls we ordered... BUT if there's ONE THING you must try... it's the BBQ AHI (tuna) NIGIRI. HO-LEE-SH*T. I thought I died and went to sushi heaven... We ordered a total of 10 orders of the BBQ ahi nigiri... yup... 20 pieces. It's THAT good. If you love sushi and you're ever in Reno, you have to try that damn BBQ ahi nigiri... great stuff! Overall, every maki roll, nigiri, handroll we ordered was very well plated and delicious! High quality fish and what I thought was excellent service! We just found our new annual sushi spot in Reno!",1,"good"
"3","def come to this bigger, newer locay INSTEAD of the tiny, old, small-portion original!!!...our experience @the other one wasn't good jus a couple of mos ago...so, we were hesitant to take the folks to this sister resto...but decided we'd give it a chance...& glad the 4 of us did...tho we considered other AYCE sushi bars @several hotels, Sushi Pier offers some apps for our fam... lunch 11a-3p, $17.95 (kids 7 & undr: $9.95)...din 3-9:30p (avail all day if u want din long rolls too), $23.95 (kids $15.95)...made-to-order sushi & jap noms...

"4","I have been to most of all the sushi places in Reno/Sparks and this used to be my favorite. This is no longer on any list to offer to someone as a suggestion. It seems that cleanliness has been a long forgotten necessity here. The sushi chefs while pleasant have consistently been lacking in enthusiasm or the art of conversation. We have always chosen to sit at the sushi bar and have eaten at a table when we came with a group. 
First impression of employee using a moist wash cloth was to clean the counters at either the bar or sushi bar but it served as there was food still remaining on the counter. It serves no purpose if one doesn't understand the need to clean the surface! When we sat at the bar while waiting for our counter seat to eat, the countertop had oil smears and was sticky. I watched the bartender use a soft cloth to clean the wine glasses and then use the same towel to dry his hands, even though I watched him two minutes later use a cloth he had tied to his apron to wipe his hands. He then disappeared only to come back to help new customers with their orders and never wash his hands. The plates are worn out. They are chipped and the designs have literally worn off. The silverware handles have edges are sharp enough that makes them uncomfortable to use. I was asked if I would like a refill of my soda. I handed her my glass and she put her finger on the lip of the cup as she had another patrons plate in her hands. She gave me back my same cup but am hoping that her finger never came in contact with my drink! At least the single use chopsticks come in a paper wrapper! A smile would go a long way and maybe infect the customers to have a great experience. 
Overall, the food has been degrading as evidenced by the curled edges and wobbly state of the cucumber wheel that was used to decorate my lackluster cocktail. The pickled ginger was so thick that it made it difficult to dunk or to plop onto my long roll. We noticed that much of the fish was coming out of plastic wrapped packages that was being opened with the same knives use to prepare our entree. So if that's ok to do in front of the customers what happens in the out of view? 
I'm sure they won't miss my business as they are no longer the only game in town. Thank goodness I live in the gold ole USA and have choices and know a dirty restaurant when when I see one!",1,"bad"
"5","This was a little bit ago (within the last year), but I still warn people of this incident when they want to choose Sushi Pier 2 as our sushi dining location - and after, we always go somewhere else.

Let me start by saying that when this location was in Park Lane mall, I went three separate times - two of these times were horrendous, one was extremely enjoyable. Based on that ONE enjoyable experience, when some coworkers and friends wanted to go for a dinner I gave in.

It was a mistake that I will never make again.

We sat at a table large enough for us - 5 adults, and 1 child. Let me note: by ""child"" I mean a baby that was under 2 years old. The mother of the child had a glass of water and was only there for our company, as she had to go meet her husband for dinner later. This was all explained to our waitress, who was short and snippy with us, and hardly paid attention to us throughout our dinner. The mother and her baby left about 15 minutes after sitting with us and laughing about the work day.

We waited and waited for our orders to be taken; we waited and waited for food to be delivered. Since we were all enjoying all-you-can-eat at a table in the middle of the restaurant, and the bars were far from full, I'd expect the service to be better. The waitress really neglected our table, and gave us maybe one refill of waters, but we laughed and talked and tried to just enjoy our meal (what bits of a meal we were able to enjoy, as the longer she took to get the order, the more time the rice had to expand while we drank water since we were so hungry).

Needless to say, we hardly ate $22 worth of fish each. When the bills came, we each had separate bills - ALL OF WHICH CHARGED WITH AUTOMATIC GRATUITY! Since there were four adults eating at the table, I asked her about it and she said it was a table for six and that the computer system ""automatically does that"" - and that's just a summary of our conversation! She had the WORST attitude about it, like there was nothing wrong with charging a table of four people automatic gratuity for her sorry excuse for customer service.

When I asked her to remove it, she scoffed at me and VERY reluctantly did so. I also told her to refund the amount to everyone else's tabs, and she glared and mumbled the whole time.

I will never return to this restaurant, even if someone else is paying for the meal. All she needed to do was pay more attention to our table and make the adjustment prior to just charging us for her own tip. Talk about selfish.",2,"bad"
