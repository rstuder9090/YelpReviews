"2","Our new favorite sushi joint now that sushi alive has moved across town. It is small authentic and I believe family owned. It is not a trendy upscale hotspot.  It is a bright clean quiet place where you can dress comfortably and bring the whole family. We were seated in  a private booth right away on a saturday night at 6:45pm.  Our server was a pleasant young man who was very professional and attentive and brought our food out very quickly. Their happy hour special is pretty amazing with many choices of $3 rolls and $1 Nigiri and they even offer it on fri & sat evenings (until 7pm) which is kind of unheard of. They offer many fruit flavored sakes which I enjoy trying raspberry is my favorite so far but I can't wait to try the lychee!! We had steamed gyoza which were hot & delicious.  The veggie tempura is pretty good and comes with 2 pcs each of broccoli sweet potato carrot and onion although the dipping sauce tasted a little watery. The sushi and Nigiri were all very fresh. In particular the spicy tuna roll was excellent and I will order it every time. My only disappointment with this restaurant is that they don't offer any real crab rolls only krabstick.",1,"good"
"3","Sushi-Haru is a tiny little sushi bar and Japanese restaurant located along Northdale Boulevard in northern Carrollwood, directly across the street from Whole Foods. I was planning a trip to Whole Foods one evening, and wanted to find a place for dinner. My trusty Yelp bookmarks alerted me to Sushi-Haru, and off I went to eat fishies.

Behind the traditional cloth curtain divider at Sushi-Haru, you'll find a small sushi bar with seating for 8 patrons. There are also some small private booth areas for families and groups. On the night that I was there, the restaurant was staffed by one lady who took the orders, delivered the food, and cleaned up the tables. There was also a gentleman behind the sushi bar, who doubled as the cook in their prep kitchen. Perhaps they have more helpers during busier times, but the place was spotlessly clean, and run very efficiently despite the small staff.

There is a sushi bar menu with traditional nigiri and sashimi options, and dozens and dozens of different sushi rolls. They also have a full Japanese foods menu, but I didn't bother looking as I was only interested in the sushi. If you're a lover of sushi rolls, then you'll find about 60 on the menu, and a few more on their specials board. You'll need some time to read through everything, and decide upon your favorites.

I ordered a seaweed salad to start while watching the sushi chef prepare someone else's dinner. Once I was satisfied with his technique and the freshness of the fish in the case, I placed an order for a nigiri platter with a wide variety of sushi choices. My platter had the usual tuna, yellow tail, salmon, mackerel, and whitefish, but I also added spicy tuna, yellowtail, conch, and scallop. Unlike a lot of sushi restaurants, the chef prepared the spicy nigiri using finely-chopped fish, rather than the usual minced gruel. The fish and seafood were very fresh and delicious, and the chef's sushi rice had the perfect balance of vinegar, sugar, and salt. Nothing was dripping with sauces, and so you were able to taste the fish, and not some gastromolecular gooey topping.

I was quite surprised by the quality of the sushi in this small restaurant, and decided to finish my meal with a real Japanese delicacy -- sweet head-on shrimp. The head of the shrimp is separated from the rest of the body, dipped in a very light tempura batter, and flash fried. The body of the shrimp is left raw. You can slurp the shrimp brains, and then chomp on the shrimp body - much like eating a crawfish. It's not for everyone, but a real treat for those who like it.

Sushi-Haru serves up some very delicious sushi, and it's worth a visit if you want to try something very tasty for dinner. Oh, and don't worry, they also serve the usual deep-fried, stuffed with cream cheese, and covered with sauces kinda rolls that are so popular.",2,"good"
"4","I ate at this restaurant for the first time last night.  I typically eat sushi at Sushi Alive but there was a long wait so my boyfriend and I thought we'd try out Sushi Haru.

The sushi rolls were good, though mine weren't rolled very tightly and were kind of falling apart.

My complaints: I had the ginger salad and it was literally just lettuce and ginger dressing (no cucumbers or carrots which these salads typically contain).  I also asked for spicy mayo and it had way too much mayonnaise for my liking.  Lastly, the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is really a downer. The restaurant seems a bit unclean, the decor is old and it was so quiet and depressing inside.

Sushi Alive is worth the wait in my opinion and I won't be going back to Sushi Haru.",1,"bad"
"5","The food here is decent, but not great...the service was horrible! Sat at the sushi bar and asked the lady about looking at the happy hour menu and she said no and walked away...I then spoke to the sushi chef who just handed me a regular menu. I asked him a second time about the happy hour menu they have advertised on huge signs on their window and he said happy hour isn't from 5-7 anymore, and only until 6 pm. So i ordered a few rolls on the regular menu and a soup and salad...about ten minutes later, two people were seated next to me and had asked for happy hour menus and were able to order at happy hour prices with it being 6:20 pm. At this point during my meal, my check was already brought to the table for some odd reason although I wasn't done ordering or eating and wasn't asked anything at all and I  did inform her I would be getting a few other pieces of nigiri. When I asked why the people next to me were able to order happy hour items and I was not, the lady just sighed and said ok what you want... well, besides my water that you never brought me (although I'm almost done with my meal), I did want a few pieces of the $1 nigiri sushi on special. It's not like I was ordering 20 pieces of Salmon as the people next to me did. I ordered 4 pieces and still got attitude from the lady who still did not want to change the receipt to reflect any happy hour prices...then she just never came back after she charged my card and dropped it back off to me...I'd rather go elsewhere next time regardless of the convenience of this location to my work...",2,"bad"
