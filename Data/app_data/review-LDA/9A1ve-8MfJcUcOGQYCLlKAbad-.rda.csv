"2","Umami is a newly opened pan-Asian restaurant serving authentic Japanese, Korean and Thai food. I live in Chicago, but I go to Nashville often to visit family and friends (I stayed in Brentwood area), so it was nice timing for me to try out this new restaurant and I got to try a lot of their menu items with our group. They've got a great variety of dishes on their menu, and everything we had was delicious. You can tell that everything is made from scratch here, as well as using fresh, authentic ingredients. Here's my review on each item, in no particular order:

Kimchi fries: This is a fun take using a Korean classic (the kimchi) and an American snack (cheese fries). I loved all the flavors and textures on this dish: crispy hot french fries topped with ooey, gooey nacho cheese, sauteed kimchi, scallions, and a white sauce that I can only guess is mayo (or sour cream?). I will try to update this when I find out. 

Korean Fried Chicken: One of their more popular items (according to our server). You can select the soy garlic or the spicy sauce, or go half and half with your order (6 pcs, 10 pcs, 20 pcs, 30 pcs). I wanted my son to be able to try it, so I opted for the soy garlic. That did NOT disappoint! It's the perfect blend of that umami flavor that comes from soy sauce paired with the garlic flavor. It comes with a side of pickled radishes that is the perfect complementary crunch with your chicken. This is actually how fried chicken is served in Korea, and it's excellent. No need to travel all the way to Seoul!

Tuna poke: this is your classic tuna poke (pronouned poh-kae), which is a salad of raw tuna, cucumber and avocados. There were large chunks of fresh tuna, marinated and seasoned well (not overpowering the tuna or anything). 

Speaking of fresh...can't get any fresher with the sashimi plate! We got a variety of sashimi to share, and I seriously loved every type of fish! If you're adventurous, you can try the freshly fried shrimp head if you order the sweet shrimp sashimi. The kitchen basically deep-fries the actual shrimp head that's taken off the body of the raw shrimp. For some of you, that sounds like something that could be shown on Andrew Zimmern's show, Bizarre Foods. But like he says on his show...if it looks good, eat it!!!!!!! Ahng!!!!! 

Mango Tango Maki Roll: one of the recommendations from our server -- did not disappoint! I asked for this roll without cream cheese (I just do not prefer to have any cream cheese in any of my rolls) and it was not even an issue (I mention this, because some restaurants don't like to customize the maki roll orders -- ""no substitutes"" policy at those places). I don't think I've ever had a ""sweet"" maki roll before, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors of this roll. The spicy crab and mango/strawberry actually went really well together. I'm glad that they can be inventive with their maki rolls, as well as serve the usual crowd favorites. 
Side note: I love the fun names of the maki rolls -- ranging from ""Pokemon Go"", ""Music City"", and ""the ""OMG Roll"" (I imagine this one will make you say OMG haha)

Korean Chicken Tacos: You can choose from beef, chicken or pork for the Korean tacos. My son loves chicken, so we just went with the safer option (still delicious). I guess we could have tried the combo, I think that comes with one of each taco, maybe? This is also a very fun take on some classic Korean flavors with a little Mexican twist: the chicken has a Korean marinade, topped with Asian pickled radishes and cilantro, served in a warm corn tortilla.

Seafood Ramen: If you're familiar with and (like me) LOVE the Chinese-Korean noodle dish called ""Jjam-bbong"", then you will equally fall in love with this dish! The noodles are obviously the ramen noodles, but in the spicy seafood broth that is used for the ""jjam-bbong"" dish. I can tell that they use fresh seafood for the broth, because it's spicy and refreshing, not fishy at all! I was actually thinking about this bowl the next day...and how much I wanted to eat it again. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back to get this dish again!

Beer Selection: They have an AWESOME beer selection, with some local and international beers. I love checking out local beers wherever I go, and the ones I tried were awesome. They also have some great ones on tap. 
Fun tip: Order a large pitcher of beer, and it comes out in this REALLY fun pitcher that has dry ice and flashing lights -- so flashing smoke from your pitcher. It's not just for funsies, though...it keeps your beer nice and cold so that every pour is just as refreshing as the first.

I saw a lot of people coming in for pick-up orders, so if you don't have time to sit down in the restaurant, you could always call ahead and pick up on your way home (or wherever you're headed).

Overall, a wonderful meal and experience at Umami. Keep it up, guys! I'll be coming back soon.",1,"good"
"3","Update: 
Since that first negative experience, we have eaten here at least 10 more times. Every experience since the first one has been fantastic! The food is always consistently amazing. The service is typically great (that first waitress must have left!). We have eaten at a lot of sushi places in Nashville and Franklin, and Umami continues to be our favorite!! We will definitely continue eating here.

Initial review:
We were so excited to eat here. The restaurant that was here before this place was Sushi Me, and that was our favorite spot. We were welcomed right away by the new owner when we arrived. She was very kind and informed us that they still have the same sushi chef that Sushi Me had. Greatest news ever to us! I will say, everything we ordered was amazing! Some of the greatest sushi in Nashville, in our opinion. 

However, the waitress we were given is one of the worst waitresses we have ever had in our lives. By checking in there for the first time on Yelp, you can claim a free egg roll. So we ordered that soon after arriving. And then we placed our drink orders and sushi order. We had to repeat the sushi order 3 times. She wasn't even familiar with the menu. I ordered moscato. I had to show it to her on the menu because she didn't know what that was! Same with the beer order. It wasn't a lack of understanding us at all, it's like she has never heard of any item from their menu. We sat there for at least 30 minutes with no drinks and no egg roll. I noticed that our drinks had been sitting up on the bar ready for her to bring to us. This waitress was running around appearing to be messing up other customers' tickets and orders. She kept having to get the manager. Her other tables (maybe 2 other tables) looked very aggravated, as we did. I was almost to the point of going up to the bar and getting our drinks. We finally caught her attention and asked about our drinks. She had definitely forgot and went to go get them. I asked about the egg roll. She forgot about that too, and never put the order in. She assured it would be out soon. The place was busy so we had to wait longer than usual for our sushi, but that was understandable. Finally, our sushi arrived. But no egg roll. I asked if we could have that too. She forgot. She assured it would be out soon. I will say again, the sushi was delicious! We finished all 4 rolls and finished our drinks. The waitress never once came to check on us and see if we needed anything. We finally caught her attention after sitting there for quite awhile with our empty plates and glasses, and we told her we were ready for the check and that egg roll. She forgot. She asked if maybe we could just get our egg roll next time. Are you kidding me?! I said, no we ordered it over an hour ago. We want it now. We actually wanted it before our meal. She just walked away. About another 10 minutes later she comes out with the ticket and the egg roll. In the meantime, one of her other 2 tables was getting irritated and went up to owner asking for their ticket. She never said thank you to us or sorry for our long wait or anything. 

In conclusion, this waitress made our experience here terrible. We wasted a lot of our Friday night sitting and waiting to be served. It was ridiculous. We definitely want to come back here because we are in love with the quality of the food. And we liked the atmosphere. But if we are ever given this waitress again we will demand a different one. All of the other waiters and waitresses seemed to be doing an excellent job. But this place is going to continue to have angry customers if they don't do something about this horrible waitress. We weren't the only ones unhappy last night.",2,"good"

It looked like there was only one server for the restaurant, that being the wife of the owning couple. She amazingly had control of many tables. But when the restaurant got half full, it was obvious she needed extra assistance. She often greeted customers by yelling from across the restaurant when she saw them. I often heard customers wondering what she said.

I ordered the Pad Thai. She asked if I wanted it mild, medium or spicy. I told her mild since I didn't want to mask the flavors with heat. For the record, mild is more like medium. There was a strong heat presence. So, if you are sensitive to spice and like things mild, I would recommend asking for no spice. Then, perhaps you would actually get mild!

The plating looked odd because there was a mound of noodles topped with chopped green onion on one side of the plate. Then, there was a slightly dried out lime wedge, a pile of thinly spiraled carrot and a pile of chopped peanuts on the other side. It looked like I had asked for Pad Thai with the peanuts on the side! The odd plating aside, the noodles were horribly mushy that they were broken into child-safe lengths. I felt like I needed a spoon to eat it.

One of the first things we ordered was the Korean fried chicken in soy and garlic. We were told it takes 20-25 minutes. It came out after our main dishes even though we ordered our mains after the chicken; so I would recommend ordering it before sitting down if you can. The dish looked delicious and ate that way too. That was this meal's saving grace. The chicken was crispy but thoroughly coated with glaze. Wing size was pretty decent and the restaurant comes with a handwashing station so you can eat with abandon, lick your fingers and go wash your hands before eating anything else.

As with driving a new car out of the dealership lot, the Korean fried chicken immediately depreciates in value (crispy value, that is) when taken to-go. So, I would recommend dining in for your first KFC experience.

The Korean fried chicken is the only reason to come to this place. Just be sure to wear some slip resistant shoes!",1,"bad"
"5","As per all Lenox Village restaurants there is such a missing piece and it's hard to put a finger on what it is exactly, but I will tell you about our Sunday experience. 
We walked in and there were 4 people at the bar and 2 tables in the dining room that were each getting ready to leave. No one greeted us but we walked to the bar and grabbed 2 seats. There wasn't a bartender but after a couple of minutes we saw, much to our pleasant surprise, Tessa come out of the kitchen!! We love Tessa from The Other Place and were so happy to see her here! She took great care of us. We had the wings that are like nothing else in the world. We have had them several times and they never disappoint! The unfortunate thing is that you can't tell the difference between the soy and spicy because the spicy are not, at all, spicy.
We also got the gyoza which was delicious and the unagi. which was horrible. Unagi is my go-to sushi when I am just too starving to pick anything else out and this eel was mushy. I have never had that happen before so I was concerned and spit out the one I had and didn't touch the other one.
I would have told Tessa, however, in the hour we were there she had 10 (TEN) take-out orders so she didn't have a second to breathe. In the meantime the other 2 servers were just strolling around and talking with no guests at tables. Tessa was working her butt off putting together these orders, answering the phone with MORE orders AND waiting on the people at the bar. I'll tell you what....she never stopped smiling and being pleasant so this is clearly not an issue with her, but with the lack of teamwork or staffing or something! I honestly left there feeling so angry that if it weren't for those darn crack-wings I would say I was never going back.
As for the other missing piece? If you are going to advertise sports viewing you should definitely jump up the tv and sound game. The projected tv is really hard to see and the volume is so quiet you can hear EVERYTHING in the kitchen and with other guests. Maybe figure a way to get larger or other TV's and get a clearer sound system?
The two positives for me right now are the wings and Tessa so I hope that's enough for me to want to go back next time. Honestly, I really hope it is because Michelle is so sweet and I want to support her!",2,"bad"
