"2","I visited Vitascope Hall five times while in New Orleans over a week. My experiences varied as certain days the service was slow although the restaurant was empty but the food was always wonderful and the servers attentive and great! The Creamy Cavatappi blew my mind. It was creamy flavorful and a huge dish, I took my left overs and ate them before the plane ride home. The alligator sausage and the crawfish were excellent on the pasta. My second favorite dish was the New York Steak. The potatoes were delicious and the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender, it cut like butter. My next was the Nola Fish and Chips. I subbed wedges for fries and it was crazy good. I also had the Catch of the Day, I didn't get the fishes name (not salmon) it was flavorful and I didn't go into a food coma full of regret although I will always prefer the comfort foods. I also had the Quattro Formaggi pizza. It was good but not what I expected from what is described. My reason for the 4 star is because of the plastic type plates. When cutting my steak the plate kept spinning. Especially being we were in the small booth that allowed us to people watch. For steak, you need real plates that will not move a centimeter I believe. Other than that, my experience was amazing and I miss the pasta and the elegance of the restaurant with the beautiful bar. Thanks for the experiences!",1,"good"
"3","This review is based on 3 separate occasions throughout my trip in New Orleans.

This is one of the restaurants located in the Hyatt Regency Downtown as well as the restaurant that provides the room service to the hotel. If you choose to eat in the establishment the atmosphere is nice. It has the feel of an ""upscale"" sports bar. I mean for 10 dollars a beer, it better at least look high end. Tvs are everywhere as well as private tables with personal Televisions. This would be a good spot to watch a game.

I ordered breakfast, lunch, and a dinner meal throughout my stay. The first order I received was to the room for breakfast. The service was very quick. It took at most 20 minutes for the food to be delivered on two separate occasions. The food, depending on what you get, is hit or miss. For breakfast I received a spinach egg white omelet with breakfast potatoes and croissant. The potatoes and croissant were delish! The main on the other hand was undercooked and runny. Not what I was expecting for 25 dollars plus tip. The second order I placed was for lunch. Again, very fast delivery! This time I got the Cajun chicken pasta. It definitely had potential but was lacking salt and pepper, both of which were not provided in the bag. The last time I ordered dinner at the restaurant. I received buffalo wings, fries, and sushi. The wings were very crispy and flavorful! The fries...well they could use some salt but did not diminish the quality of the meal. The sushi... OH THE SUSHI. It was delicious! I would continue to order that sushi every time I had a craving if I lived in New Orleans. If you come to
This restaurant give it a go! Overall the dinner food was way more impressive than the breakfast and lunch options.  I would only come back for the sushi.",2,"good"
