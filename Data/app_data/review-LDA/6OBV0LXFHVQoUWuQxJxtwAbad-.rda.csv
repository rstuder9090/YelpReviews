"2","my husband and i always get the groupon for fulins when it comes up.  it's one of our favorite places to go for a ""nicer"" dinning experience. the steamed chicken dumplings appetizer is one of our favorites, and the egg flower soup is pretty splendid as well...i will actually go to fulin's just because i'm craving egg drop/flower soup.  we've always had great service here too. the servers have a professional manner, which my husband and i appreciate for a calm, nice dinning experience. 
reading through some of the other reviews, the chicken i've gotten has always been cooked perfectly, the california roll is pretty yummy, and i think they do nice job of serving delicious food from several ethnic cuisines. 
awesome: steamed chicken dumplings; egg flower soup, general tsu's chicken, mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and spicy sesame beef.",1,"good"
"3","Fresh everything-and I'm vegan. I ordered the Joy Roll and they gladly substituted asparagus for the cream cheese and it was above par, very much so. See the pic! Fresh!!!! I ate every. single. piece. Then, the superbly friendly waiter said she could probably approve my request to substitute broccoli in place of the chicken in the Chicken with Cashew Nuts entree. It was the bomb! The lo mein noodles were the bomb-what can I say-they were the bomb, see the pic. Better yet-go there-give them your biz so I can continue to frequent them because they're in my neighborhood. Excellent service from my new girl Christy. The place could use a deep clean but you should see my house; I'm short-staffed toooo!!!",2,"good"
"4","Wife and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon (before dinner rush). The food sucked. I had general Tso's chicken with fried rice, and added a side of noodles. The rice was really dry (no egg, no veggies, I first thought it was just brown rice) , noodles taste like burnt oil (almost smoky, in not a good way), and the chicken tasted like something microwaved, maybe fried, then tossed in pre made sauce. I don't know why they labeled it as spicy on the menu. It was very mild and I'm not convinced they didn't confuse it for the orange chicken sauce. My broccoli was also cold. 

My wife got a sashimi plate . The cuts were inconsistent and the fish was not fresh. Some pieces were fresh, but other cuts (hacks of fish) were very fishy and not fresh tasting. All were cut poorly, as shown in the photo. I RARELY leave reviews but this was ridiculous. They had some kid who didn't look like he knew what he was doing running the sushi bar by himself and it was a joke. 

We also ordered a roll. It took much longer than our other plates to arrive. It was maybe a 2/5 in terms of taste and quality. The fried shrimp in the roll was not tempura. Looked like it was fried in the same shit as everything else. 

Everything that came out of the kitchen seemed relatively lazy and lackluster. I could understand if the place was packed/busy, but it wasn't. It was at maybe 25% capacity. 

Wife said her miso soup and salad was decent. 

The cocktails, while affordable, weren't potent or well made. I don't know what kind of Mai Tai comes in a 22 oz glass or tastes like some sort of lemonade but it was garbage. Isn't this Nashville??!! (close enough, anyway) I would have rather paid twice as much for a well made cocktail with half the volume. At least a good cocktail would have helped salvage the cruddy food. 

Our waiter was nice, but inexperienced. Pretty sure he was wearing sweatpants. 

This is definitely not authentic Asian cuisine. Hell, I would have enjoyed Panda Express more than this garbage. They have a lot on their menu, but aren't good at particularly anything. 

Not to mention they sat people right next to us -- during a pandemic -- indoors -- when they had ample seating to space to seat us farther apart. 

We will not be returning. Spend your money elsewhere. I was looking for something The Asian Peak quality, but closer to home. This isn't it.",1,"bad"
"5","I have always loved Fulins for Birthday celebration, family dinners and dinner before the movie! My husband and I went on 3/29/17 for the last time!!!! The crab rangoon was burnt the orange chicken was very over cooked I didn't even eat half and left it there! The fried rice was in a small bowl that looked like brown rice with a piece of fried egg (I can do better)!! I have always loved the fried rice that has always been served on a platter or plate with egg, carrots and peas and loved it! in my previous years of going there!
 My spring roll was a large egg roll size stuffed with cabbage, spring rolls are not that!!
  I ordered a drink with coconut rum and this tropical drink that was 7 bucks didn't have a garnishment of fruit and an umbrella like previous visits and I didn't feel any alcohol at all like previous visits (Some expensive fruit punch for sure) Wow!!! 
The waiter was a nice kid who did share with me that the cook was sick and the hostess had called out also they were very short handed!(Very slow business also)
 My husband ate his shrimp but was not happy with our experience( My husband doesn't like to complain) However when the fortune cookie came with our 65 dollar bill plus tip! My husband said you don't need to open it I know what it says ""YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED!!!!!""
I called the next day and asked to speak with the manager and she said I am one!
 I told her of our terrible experience and said I don't know if I just hit a bad night I understand your cook was sick and that was all she heard from that point on! she said your waiter told you that? Why didn't you ask for a manager when you were there? She was reprimanding me... I had already told her and told her again that my husband does not like to complain but I felt she needed to know how terrible the food was and I was just wandering as my husband had mentioned if they were on a sinking ship?She said NO we have had the same cook for a year! She was not apologetic at all! She needs to care about customer complaints and concerns!!!  She said the fried rice had always come like that! Not in my many years of going there! It was a dead ears conversation she didn't care to hear it!
 So knowing what I ordered what It looked like and what it tasted like in the previous years! THAT FOOD IS GONE!!!! Save your money and your stomach from the pain!!!!!!!! We are never returning!!!!!!!!",2,"bad"
