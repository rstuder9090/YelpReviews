"2","Visited on Saturday 10/29/16 at 8PM.   $84 got us two hibachi dinners and two drinks.  This place is not really a ""steak house"" but rather a teppenyaki place that also serves sushi and alcoholic beverages as well as desserts.  

We came at a peak time and had to wait about an hour but they have a nice outdoor waiting area with plenty of seating and the weather was nice so it wasn't so bad.  We signed up with the hostess and she gave us a buzzer to alert us when our table was ready. 

We were seated at a double table that had two griddles and seated 15-17 people.  First came the drinks and then the waiter took everybody's order.  I chose the $30 steak & scallop combination.  The waiter took everyone's menus and in a few minutes brought out soup for everyone. 

The soup was touted as an onion soup...the broth was hot and delicious.  It was full of those shitty fried onions that your grandma puts on green bean casseroles and raw mushrooms which I did not enjoy very much.  I think they'd be better off if they'd just use caramelized onions and cook the mushrooms a bit more.  

Next came the salads which were nothing special and looked identical to the bagged iceberg mix you can buy at any grocery store complete with shaved carrots and purple cabbage.  It was doused in a generous amount of ginger dressing which was good but there was just too much of it.  I had to dig pieces of lettuce out of the bowl of dressing and wipe them on my napkin to eat them. 

Next the chef came out and began his routine.  He was young and cute and very good at what he does.  He had a cheesy but good sense of humor and really wowed us with his skills.  He  knew all the good tricks like the fried rice heart, flipping an egg into his hat, flipping a shrimp into his pocket, and of course the onion volcano. 

Fried rice and noodles are served with every entree and they were very tasty.  I loved my steak and scallops and there was SO MUCH FOOD!  Seriously I spent the whole next day trying to eat all the leftovers. 

Our dining companions all raved about a sauce called ""yum-yum sauce"" which I tried and did not care for much.  It was like somebody added sugar to ranch dressing.  Everyone else at the table was requesting double and triple portions of the stuff and just pouring it all over their food so it's worth a try if you go...you might like it that much too! 

Like any other teppenyaki place, you go for the show and the atmosphere and less for the food but the food was also very good here.  It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion and I enjoyed it enough that I'd definitely go back.",1,"good"
"3","Have been to this location 2 times, once in Dec 2019 and again yesterday. Prior to that we had always went to Ryuu at the Brandon Mall but it closed:-(

Both times I had reservations and my party was seated quickly. Fitst time there was one open seat so there was plenty of room, 2nd time table was completely full and depending on who you are sitting with it can be a tight fit. Like all Japanese Steak Houses you will sit with groups of other parties unless you have a group of around 15 to fill up your own table which is fine and part of the fun.

Server and chef was definitely superb, fun and VERY entertaining first visit last month and pre anticipated things we needed....very attentive without being intrusive. Yesterday service and chef were fine but not fabulous like first visit.


Soup: Your typical clear broth with a small amount of mushroom and green onions but theirs is definitely extra tasty in my opinion...love it.

Salad: Basically your typical Japanese Steak House lettuce, carrot and ginger dressing.....delicious because their Ginger Dressing is extra good.

Land & Sea: Lobster, Shrimp & filet was delicious. Friend and I shared this and we both still got our own soup, salad, rice, noodled, vegetables etc for no extra fee which we loved. Everything perfect. 

Sirloin & Lobster:  Boyfriend got this, Lobster was delicious and perfectly cooked which was fabulous since Japanese Steak Houses have a tendency to overcook seafood. Steak was much tougher than expected and in bigger than bite size pieces and was not given a knife. 

Larger order of shrimp: My entree, was so shocked at the huge amount of shrimp for the price of$29...waitress said 15 but I went for it any way cause boyfriend and I love the leftovers. Delicious meal.

Side of mushrooms: got these on my 2nd visit since the couple of mushrooms I got during my first visit were so delicious and wish I had more; this time they left them in way to large of pieces and did not cook them enough. Will definitely get again but will make sure to ask them to be cut smaller and cooked longer. $5 seems like allot for some mushrooms but it was a large portion, they should offer a small and large portion. 

Hot Sake: Great value at only $6

Kobe Breeze: friend got this first visit, she absolutely loved it, too sweet for me but did have a very tropical taste if you're in the mood for something tropical. 

Will definitely be back to Kobe.",2,"good"
