"2","My football-watching gang decided to go out for dinner to celebrate the Buccaneers thrilling victory over the Steelers this past week, and we were able to score a reservation at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse along Dale Mabry in Carrollwood. The folks at the restaurant must have sensed that we were going to be a wild & crazy group as they put us in one of the back dining rooms and assigned a top-notch showman / chef to keep us entertained.

For those who've not been to Kobe before, this is a Teppanyaki or Hibachi cooking restaurant. You are seated on three sides of an open flat-top grill, and you interact with the chef as they prepare succulent steak, chicken, and seafood dishes according to the ancient Hibachi style of food preparation. Each chef brings their own sense of humor and spontaneity to the table, and all entrees are prepared in a display of flashing knives and exotic aromas.

Most of us ordered a Japanese beer to start while we perused the menu. Each Teppanyaki entr√©e came with Japanese clear onion soup, crisp green salad with miso dressing, freshly-grilled oriental vegetables, grilled noodles, and fried rice. Several of us ordered sushi rolls and Gyoza dumplings as appetizers, and those were passed around and quickly devoured. 

For our main course, we had our choice of any of the following, or combinations of the following: Sirloin steak, Filet Mignon, center-cut NY Strip steak, chicken breasts, shrimp, Maine lobster, sea scallops, wild salmon, or wagyu beef. I opted for the Surf n' Turf special of a Filet and shrimp. First up were the soups and salads while we waited for the grill to reach optimal temperature and our chef to arrive.

After cleaning and oiling the grill, our chef started by mixing up individual containers of the two different sauces which were set down in front of each of us -- a seasoned mustard mayo sauce for seafood and veggies, and a brown sauce for meats. And then the fun started.... the chef was busy grilling up the veggies and the rice while dazzling us with the clanging of his spatula, rapping of the pepper mill, and amazing knife skills. We've all heard the jokes before, but this guy was quite good, and we thoroughly enjoyed playing along as he spun the egg on the grill before flipping it up and balancing it on his spatula. A couple of quick Hai, Hai, Hai's and the egg was cracked into the pile of rice, and mixed up.

He did the amazing Veg-o-Matic trick with his knife and diced the veggies before our eyes. Next came the volcano made of onion slices (Ooooooo, Ahhhhhhh!), before the chef started flipping pieces of cooked vegetables into our waiting mouths. Yes, I felt like a damned sea lion at Point Loma, CA waiting for my treat, but we were all laughing hysterically by this point. The chef sliced up all of the different proteins and started portioning everything out as he continued his masterful display of shifting things around on the grill while cracking jokes. Even though we've seen the trick hundreds of times before, we all cheered as he sliced the tail off the shrimp and flipped it up into his tall chef's hat. Hai!

The meal wasn't cheap, but it was a heck of a lot of fun, and the food was delicious. The entertainment value of our meal was priceless, and we gave our chef a standing ovation at the conclusion of his cooking repertoire. 

Kobe is a great place for the entire family, and kids are very easily entertained by the whole thing. We saw another table celebrating a birthday for one of the young girls in their group. She was beaming from ear-to-ear as they dressed her in a chef's hat and served her a birthday dessert accompanied by singing and banging on the ceremonial gong.",1,"good"
"3","Kobe is mmm mmmm good for Japanese hibachi style food cooked right in front of you. If you're looking for a delicious yet different and exhilarating dinner experience with some friends or a loved one, Kobe is a fantastic choice leaving you feel stuffed by the end of it. The dinner portions are huge, so definitely come hungry or ready to take some home for later.  I came with friends on a Saturday night which was a bit of a busy time to come. Luckily my friends had called ahead to make sure our group had priority seating which definitely cut our wait time significantly. Upon arrival, there appeared to be quite a bit of guests who hadn't put their name on the list from calling ahead of time and were having to wait a while. 

The presentation is nice upon walking in, along with a koi fish fountain pond aquarium for the entryway display.  The waiting area is spacious and clean, with more seating area and tvs at the bar for a comfortable wait in general. 

The seating arrangement is by groups of about 10 around the hibachi grill, so there is a high chance you would sit with other strangers.  It's cool to make new friends though!

I ordered a glass of the red cabernet sauvignon wine at the bar to start and took it with me to the table since we were seated quickly.  I noticed the floors in the dining area to be a little slick, which startled me a little bit, as i was in heels and carrying a glass of red wine. So for safety reasons,  I suggest Kobe consider putting some non slippery grip for the walking area, since essentially the dining area is the kitchen too so floors can get slick from the atmosphere. 

Anyways, the food was very good and definitely enjoyed watching it being cooked in front of me. The chef was very talented and wowed his audience with classic egg and spatula juggling, onion choo choo train,  fried rice heart beat, and impressive flames!! I ordered the filet mignon cooked medium rare and scallops duo which also comes with salad and soup, fried rice and lo mein noodles, and seared vegetables, along with the white looking creamy dipping sauce. They used to automatically give the brown ginger tasting dipping sauce,  but is now apparently only given upon request. 

The staff, bartenders and chefs were always very nice and courteous. I will be back again soon :)",2,"good"
