"2","I've been to Sachi on Chapala and Kai on State Street, but didn't realize there was a sushi place inside Paseo Nuevo until pretty much now. Came in with Japanese comfort food in mind, but left with an order of rolls as well.

Tempura Udon - Love how the soup was packaged in a separate container, Sushi Ai in Goleta did not do the same for my takeout recently, and it was a soggy mess. Thank you thank you thank you. The udon by itself isn't expensive, but the toppings are an easy $3-4 extra. Options include Chicken, Gyoza, Pork Belly, Seafood, or Steak. The Mixed Tempura was a good choice, the vegetables were fried nicely and the shrimp was tasty. Wish they just had a simple beef udon.

Chicken Teriyaki Bento - This was a feast. Sweet glazed slices of chicken laying on a bed of rice, with a side salad and an orange slice to go along with it. It also comes with six California rolls, two fried gyozas, and a (potato? sorry I forgot) croquette. Very filling compared to the soups, and more variety compared to the rice bowls. For additional $$, you can have an extra serving of beef, chicken, or tempura.

Sweet Crunch Shrimp Roll - premium version of the Shrimp Tempura Roll essentially. Very similar ingredients: shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, avocado, sweet soy. Not too sure if it was worth it, I might've just gone with the regular one instead.
Small interior with only space for a few to socially distance. Outside area is nice to sit on warm days, with umbrellas providing shade.",1,"good"
"3","That's probably the cheapest Japanese food you can find in Santa Barbara that serves decent food.

I often eat there whenever I need to grab something to eat while shopping in paseo. Their rolls tastes good, as well as their chicken curry bowl, my favorite.

The lady at the counter is very nice and always smiling, even though she doesn't speak English that well she'll do everything to get your order right. However, once served, there is no ""waiter"" present, since the restaurant is very small, it's more of a to-go / take out kind of place vibe so don't expect a refill on your water!

Side note: Don't drink the tap water they have, I believe they just pour unfiltered tap water into the water fountain.",2,"good"
"4","So We wandered into this shady small looking Sushi place. And I ordered ramen. KEEP IN MIND U PAY UPFRONT, shady m8. For some reason they only had spicy ramen. Hmmmmmmmmm. They didn't have normal ramen broth , only spicy for some reason. I wonder whyyyyy.... is it because they only have spicy packaged ramen in stock and they just add a fu*kin egg and some frozen beef to the instant ramen and called that shit beef ramen? Ramen looks like instant ramen when I got it. I'm very disappointed. Prices aren't reasonable. I literally paid 9 bucks for a pack of instant ramen. I'm so sad. The chef in the back ground touched somewhere else with his glove before putting it back on the sushi that he was making. Unsanitary too? What if he scratched his ass before putting his hands back on your food? Disgusting I wanted to dip but my aunt was hungry. So we Ordered the bulgogi too, the beef was so rough and the rice was so hard . Bruh was I eating like some kind of flavored sh*t, how long was that beef in the morgue. Going back there might put me in a morgue too and they r gonna use my corpse for ""chicken ramen"" bruh I swear I'm so mad.",1,"bad"
"5","Honestly no clue how the food is but the girl working the register needs to be fired. I'm fairly sure she was stoned out of her mind. I did a good delivery there and waited for like 15 minutes for her to pack up the food I needed while it was already ready after she knew I was just standing there waiting. While I was there I watched her handle a call in order horribly but messing up the order like twice and asking the person to repeat it 3 times before she could mentally handle it I guess. I also saw her boss or some other co worker talk to her about how she's messing something up. Idk what it was about but I know it was bc she wasn't doing good. I also saw 2 customers come in and and she was literally so out of touch with reality. Like she had them repeat their order multiple times and she literally froze like a statue for like 20 seconds after they said they wanted to order the same thing. It was super weird and the customers were weirded out. And then when together paid in cash I saw her mess up giving change twice before she got it right. Also every customer order I watched her take she didn't give them a number meaning she made them take out even though they were for dining in and I know that bc some lady came in complaining about how she never got an number and how she was waiting for her food when it had been ready sitting in a to go back before I even got there. She's trash and should get fired. Wish I told her that when I was there. Personally I wasn't that bothered except that the longer I wait the more potential money I'm missing out on and what I watched while I was waiting was embarrassing and not professional at all",2,"bad"
