"2","Do you #love sushi? Is your favorite roll a California roll? Are you a huge fan of #chefsspecial rolls? If so you are either white or basic. And you would love this place.  Bear with me before you label me as stereotypical, racist, or surprisingly intelligent.

Initial impressions :
*restaurant is inside an office building.
*interior is huge, with high ceilings
*simple crew working inside, but none of them looked Japanese. What does a Japanese person look like, you ask? Well, Google ""samurai"" and ""anime"" and you will have your answer.
*smells like a restaurant, but ventilation is good enough for the smell to be aromatic and not linger.

The good:
-menu is big. Caters to most preferences. They have sushi as well as entrees.
-gyoza is done well. Soft but not burnt at the bottom.
-I love the decor here. Simple, modern, stylish. The lights look like cut bamboo with lights inside. Reminds me of alien scout drones tho.
-Thai beef salad is good.
-chicken thighs dish is bomb. The dish my friend got was a little undercooked. 
-the sushi. Ahhhh sushi. It's really good. I've had better, but the ingredients taste well put together and the rice is not too tough. 


The bad:
-the fried rice is too salty and soft for my taste. Others might like it, but I prefer mine not to stick together so much. Also needs more garlic flavor. 

My complaint about this place is too many special rolls. Sushi is not about putting sauce or a bunch of crazy ingredients together with fish and calling it sushi. Sushi is about simplicity, fish and rice. That's it. Japanese food is about capturing the essence of food in a simple manner, not bastardizing it with a bunch of ingredients. They've lost their soul to cater to the corporate and white crowd. For that, I weep.",1,"good"
"3","I went to Tsunami last night for my belated birthday dinner with some close friends and it exceeded my expectations. I was impressed by the ambiance, level of service we received and the food. I've been to the Tsunami in Baton Rouge many times and while the view there is spectacular, the food definitely falls short. I still wanted to try the Nola location after checking out the menu online and hearing about how trendy the restaurant was. Although this one doesn't have the rooftop view, it does have huge windows and a great view of the surrounding CBD area. We were greeted by really friendly hostesses upon walking in. The interior was gorgeous and would make for a really cute date night. Our server was awesome!! And very attentive - I think her name was Emmaline if I remember correctly. She informed us that Thursday was ""Ladies' Night"" and that one of their specialty cocktails was half off, so that was pretty cool. They have a very large selection on drinks including a sake flight that I want to return and try. I noticed that when some of our friends left the table momentarily, she refolded their linen napkins for them. I thought this was worth mentioning because I've only seen that level of service at fine dining restaurants and it was a super nice touch on her part. Anyway, moving on to the menu itmes. For dinner, our table shared several small plates. We ordered:

-Edamame hummus - surprisingly tasty
-Ika fries
-Oysters agemono
-Truffle salmon - nothing special, wouldn't order this one again
-Luscious lemonfish (my personal favorite)
-Sunflower (seared tuna in spicy ponzu, this was a table favorite)
-Sushi rolls: Transbestite, Lava, John Breaux, Munchie, and some other rolls I can't recall. The Transbestite was delicious!! It disappeared quickly. 
-Dessert: chocolate Tsunami cake with vanilla ice cream, complimentary birthday mochi, Vietnamese coffee ice cream. The Tsunami cake was really good but omg, the Vietnamese coffee ice cream was amazing!! And huge because six of us were able to share it and we still had a large scoop leftover. 

I'm happy we have another great addition to the CBD! Everyone in our group genuinely enjoyed dinner here. I can foresee it making a great lunch spot for businesses in the area as well.",2,"good"
