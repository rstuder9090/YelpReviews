"2","It's definitely a solid place if you're in the area and need cheap delivery.  Everything we ate was decently good, the delivery was quick, and the prices were great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but the food is reliably decent and you can't beat it for the price.

The egg drop soup with wontons was pretty good.  The texture was a little odd, but the flavor was definitely there.

The curry shrimp fried rice was very tasty.  It was probably my favorite thing that we got, and there was a lot more shrimp than I was expecting for how little we paid.

The sesame chicken was okay.  I'm not a fan of the type they have (breaded chicken in red sauce), but that's my fault for not asking.  

The crispy wontons we got on the side were yummy.

My boyfriend says that the chicken wings were pretty good.  Not something to write home about, but way better than McDonalds or any other fast food.

Food was about a 3, price was a 5, so I'm giving it a 4.",1,"good"
"3","I live in South Seminole Heights and work in Westchase a few days a week. I drive by this little restaurant every time I go to and from work and have ALMOST stopped several times. I went to the gym after work last week and was driving home from Clearwater STARVING and finally gave in to my craving. 

This place is right next to Wing House and since the Stanley Cup finals were on I almost went there. However, I looooove sushi and really don't like sports/wing bars so decided I would have to miss the game. Lucky me!! There was a flat screen TV showing the game...with volume...behind the sushi bar! 

I was acknowledged in a friendly manner and offered to choose where I wanted to sit, which was nice since sometimes women alone at dinner time are assumed to be waiting for a man. I chose a seat at the sushi bar and made my choices. I got a triple roll (yellowtail, tuna, salmon), a philly roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese), ika (squid) sashimi, and unagi (eel) nigiri. I don't like cucumber so all items were ordered without and arrived as such...big happy face. For $20 I really enjoyed my food. Everything was fresh and tasty and the rolls were neatly made. The only thing was that the eel pieces kind of fell apart...but that's just because they were large pieces. The pair arrived hot and with plenty of eel sauce (just about my favorite thing). 

The restaurant is really tiny, about 6 seats at the sushi bar and maybe 10 tables indoors. There's a large outdoor covered patio with a fish pond and fountain. The restrooms are outside. The photos on the Yelp site really don't look like they were taken here. Although the seats at the bar and some of the shelving is the same, the colors and layout of the building don't match up with what I saw. I'm wondering if there's a 2nd location? 

The Chinese food other people were ordering looked and smelled good and from what they were saying it tasted good too. I look forward to going back with my boyfriend (who likes Chinese food but won't touch ANY seafood).",2,"good"
