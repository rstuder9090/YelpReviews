"2","I've been eating at Koto''s since the early 90's at their location on 7th Ave N.  This is THE place for sushi in Nashville!!  No Macadamia Nuts or Mango Strawberry Blah Blah Blah Rolls here.   Only the freshest fish served in the Traditional Japanese fashion.  The wasabi isn't bright green squeeze paste from a jar - it's actual ground wasabi root.  The pickled ginger is made in house from actual ginger root.  The Green Tea, as other reviewers have mentioned, is a pungent traditional Green Tea.  And the sushi/sashimi is absolutely THE FRESHEST selection in Nashville.  Number 1 sushi grade Tuna (not cold-smoked, color-enhanced tuna block) Yellowtail, Pepper-Seared Albacore, and Fresh Salmon are all outstanding Sashimi choices.  Some of my other favorites that you are not going to find at any ""Fusion""  or Pan Asian style mish-mash concepts are Sea Urchin with Quail Egg, Steamed Monkfish Liver, Seasoned Cod Roe and Homemade Sunomono (My Favorite is with Octopus!).  The Scallop Hand Roll with tomatoes and Smelt Row, the Hook Roll (an amazing twist on a Spicy Yellowtail Roll), the Salmon Skin Roll, the Rock N Roll (wrapped in cucumber), and the Crunchy Rolls (both shrimp and crab, available with King Crab for an extra charge) are all among my ""must-have's"" almost every time I visit.  With so many outstanding choices, I find it difficult to decide every time I sit down at the sushi bar to order.  Luckily, I always have the next visit to look forward to, which is usually the highlight of my month!!
Thanks Koto's, for making sushi a culinary delight, not a trendy dissappointment!!!!",1,"good"
"3","Maybe it's the circles in which I travel, but only occasionally do I encounter really imaginative sushi. Koto, in downtown Nashville, practically explodes with creative options, many of which I eagerly ordered. 

But first, you've gotta love the inherent sense of humor on the Heart Attack appetizer, which is jalape√±o, spicy tuna and cream cheese. Other starters include Scallop Bakudon (sauteed mushroom & scallops with creamy sauce) Wasabi Shumai and Oshitashi (keep your uncultured snickering to a minimum while eating boiled spinach with dried bonito.)

Though I did order some of my favorites ( a great way to compare how different eateries prepare and present ) including saba, squid and a Rainbow Roll, I also leaped fearlessly into the adventure with two rolls that caught my eye. The Wayne Roll contains crab, eel, egg omelet, avocado and burdock roots, which are a variety of thistle and have a sweet, strong pungent flavor and crunchy consistency.

The Norro Roll features clam, smelt egg, cucumber and burdock root. Both rolls were crunchy and combined a delightful mixture of flavors that were, at first challenging, and finally extremely satisfying.

The owners of the establishment have operated Koto in various locations over the course of 27 years and were wonderful to talk to (he is from Okinawa, Japan - she is from Korea.)  They were attentive and pleasant and our server was quick with the sake and other items that we desired.  Be sure to have a good look at the Chinese Koto hanging on the wall opposite the sushi bar.  It's an amazing piece of musical architecture and, as a musician, it was all I could do to keep from reaching out to pluck its long strings.  The only thing Koto is missing would be someone jamming out on THAT thing instead of the television hanging in the corner broadcasting whatever it was that it was broadcasting.  That's the reason for the four stars - the food was exquisite, as was the service and company.  The atmosphere would've been a bit more magical without the intrusion of that omnipresent television set.

Still, worth a visit, we'll be back again next time we're in Nashville.",2,"good"
"4","Unfortunately I wasnt even able to eat at Koto... I must say we walked in 15 minutes before they closed since we got into Nashville late, most places will still serve you with a smile but NOT THIS TIME... when we walked in the server let out a huge sigh of displeasure that we had enough nerve to come in shy of them closing for the night. He promptly informed us that they were closing in 15 minutes.. we inquired about the sushi bar and he told us that the sushi bar was closed, even though there were 2 sushi chefs still standing behind the bar... that was enough for me, if they dont want my business I can clearly understand that server acting like that, I made it a point to let them know that with his attitude (I even mentioned his huge sigh) that we would find another place that wants our business.. we headed for SAMURAI on Elliston... Samurai was wonderful and by this time they were ready to close in 15 minutes as well but greeted us nicely when we came in and didnt mention it even though we knew they closed at 10pm... the service and food at SAMURAI was amazing and that is where we will spend our money on sushi at SAMURAI when we come to Nashville. As for the server working at KOTO last night.. your attitude sucks and I hope your boss reads this...",1,"bad"
"5","Everything was just very poorly made. Everything lacked flavor- the rice, the sauces for our soft shell crab & tempura, & our sushi. Me & my husband have both worked with sushi for a long time, (he's a head sushi chef & I serve at his restaurant) & you can tell that very inexperienced chefs who lack skills in prep, presentation, flavor, & structure of the rolls prepared our meals. My husband paid $22 for a dinner bento box, but of course, the portions were minuscule. The combo roll with his box was already fallen apart as it sat in the box. He didn't even have to touch it for the rolls to break. I suppose the chef simply plating it in the box was enough to break the roll.
I got a chirashi, which was over $20 & I literally felt like I got screwed over. The portion was ridiculous. They filled the bowl more than halfway with rice & then used radish to take up more space. As you can see in the photo, it appears as if there is a lot of sashimi in the bowl. But it's not. They just took one slice of each kind of sashimi, cut it in half, & placed it a certain way to create the illusion that the pieces were longer & further inside the bowl. But everything you see on the surface of the bowl is all you get. The triangular piece of albacore (the one that looks like raw chicken) SEEMS like a longer piece but it's SERIOUSLY just that triangle piece & that's it. Same goes for all the other pieces but you just can't see it in the picture. I understand due to their location, their rent is probably tremendously expensive & they have to charge a little higher, but trust me, NOTHING about this restaurant is worth how much you spend here. It gives me really cheap & run down vibes. These are the kinds of ""sushi restaurants"" you avoid to prevent getting parasites, & no, I'm not being funny. I don't know how they're still in business. I came here on a Friday night at 6:30 & there was only us & one other table.",2,"bad"
