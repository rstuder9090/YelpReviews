Ambiance -
The ambiance is what really sets this place apart and pushes it from 4 to 5 stars. You absolutely must go after it's dark out! Tucked away off of the main road is a building suspended on risers over a pond and a string of beautiful lights and Asian lanterns. I love the fact that you have to walk across a little bridge over the water to get into the restaurant. Inside is small and intimate with white tablecloths that combine comfort and elegance. This is the perfect spot for a first date and is certainly memorable. 

Food - 
We enjoyed two traditional maki (sushi rolls) and one of the specialty rolls. Everything was great! While not the best we've ever had, it was certainly good and we would come back again. 

If you're not into sushi, there are a few cooked options from the kitchen which looked good but we did not try them.

Drink - 
Tokyo Japanese Restaurant has a full bar - which isn't always the case for Asian restaurants in the suburbs! 

Value - 
We had no qualms about the prices. Expect to spend around $8 or less for a traditional roll and about $15 for a specialty roll. This are average prices for better sushi and you'll certainly pay more for the same quality in the city. Certainly a must try if you're in the area!",1,"good"
"3","It was my first visit to the downtown Skippack, PA. After we parked our car, we started to explore our dining options and stumbled upon a cute, red covered bridge which led to a beautifully landscaped hill on top of which Tokyo Japanese restaurant was situated. I was very intrigued by its secluded, charming location. The location is very quiet as the restaurant is set back from the busy street and is surrounded by beautiful gardens with tall trees, various colored bushes, a water fall or little creek and overlooks a pretty koi pond. Intrigued by its charming landscape and inviting decor, we decided to check out the restaurant. 

The wait staff members were very courteous and friendly. Food was delicious and we also loved the creative way in which each dish was presented. Very clean and artistic. We sat on the wooden patio adjacent to the koi pond, and I absolutely loved the sound of the rolling water which fed into the pond.  Very relaxing. The atmosphere was very festive as the decor was very cheerful.  I almost felt we were transported to our favorite vacation spot in Maui, Hawaii which we both loved visiting in the past.  Perhaps it was the warm weather today which tricked my mind into thinking I was dining in Maui but hey, I didn't mind it at all. Lol. I really enjoyed what this restaurant had to offer, and we had a very wonderful date night. 

My guy is Japanese and very picky when it comes to Japanese cuisine as you can imagine but he thoroughly enjoyed the food at Tokyo restaurant.  He commented that the sushi rolls were out of this world. We also tried their mixed appetizer plate consisting of saut√©ed calamari, sea weed salad and yellow tail salad with watercress. We both enjoyed the pairing of smooth, creamy tasting yellow tail with the piquant flovor of watercress. He ordered today's special sushi rolls and I had the rain bow roll. Everything tasted delicious and fresh. Their wasabi is of high quality, too. 

The friendly owner came to our table and greeted us while we were dining. I love it when the management takes time to meet and greet customers as it indicates they care seriously about customer satisfaction and quality of their service.

We will definitely visit Tokyo again and highly recommend this hidden gem. This is a perfect restaurant to go for a romantic date night or special family occasions.",2,"good"
