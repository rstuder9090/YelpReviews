"2","I decided to check out Kinjo's after reading the great reviews on Yelp. 

First Impressions:
Located in an old Pizza Hut, the exterior looks run down. Inside it is fairly dark and the tables and decor look dated. However, like another reviewer mentioned, it looks clean other than the air vents (yuck!).

They have a decent selection of sashimi and sushi rolls - though there really wasn't anything terribly unique. We ordered the Buccaneer, the Norway, and the Crazy rolls. Our server got our drinks right away and quickly took our order. 

The Ugly:
When the sushi arrived I noticed immediately that all three rolls were drenched in the orange spicy sauce (I think it is spicy mayo), however, on the menu it did not mention anything about the spicy sauce. Unfortunately, I am very allergic to anything spicy and could not eat the rolls with spicy sauce. We quickly explained it to our server who seemed completely willing to help. 

At that point, a woman wearing black glasses came up and questioned what was going on in an aggressive way. At first she said we would have to pay for it. I explained my allergy to her and told her that I was not going to pay for it as it did not say anything on the menu about there being any spicy ingredients in these rolls. Then she went to the sushi chef and came back and said there wasn't much sauce on the rolls (sorry, but they were drenched). I told her that my throat will close up and I would have to go to the hospital if I ate the rolls. My Mom, who does not have the allergy, offered to eat half of the spicy rolls if they would remake half of the rolls without the spicy sauce. The woman was being very hostile and it was getting to the point where we were just going to leave.  

I told her that I eat sushi at least once a week and that at other sushi places their menus either state all of the ingredients in the roll of they have a note specifying that not all of the ingredients are listed and to ask. Her behavior was rude, hostile, and unreasonable. 

They finally agreed to remake the rolls...

The good:
The sushi was very fresh and flavorful and the rolls were tight so they didn't fall apart. The eel sauce was very flavorful, there is a hint of spice that is unique...but whatever it is, I love it! If you like eel sauce be sure to order a side of it! 

The Ugly Take 2:
After getting the rolls and digging in, the woman once again came by and said that she needed us to go ahead and pay so they could close the register (they close at 1:00). I wasn't going to dilly dally and just wanted to get my food and get the heck out of there. Once again I felt like my patronage wasn't valued. 

Conclusion:
Sushi - 4.5 stars
Original Server - 4.5 stars

"3","This is the best Japanese restaurant and sushi bar in Saint Petersburg! The restaurant serves authentic Japanese cuisine and is named after the owner, Kinjo. It's a small place but is decorated nicely and packs amazing food and service.

There is a lot to choose from when it comes to your meal; choices such as teriyaki, katsu, and tempura. There are quite a few Japanese appetizers to get you started as well. They have awesome noodle soups; udon or soba. It's served in a big bowl and it's amazingly tasty!

They have a fully equipped sushi bar that has all of the signature raw sushi you find at most Japanese restaurants. The fish is always fresh which is awesome. For those who don't fancy raw, you can always try anything from their list of cooked sushi. They've got sushi containing things like 'krab', shrimp tempura, and crawfish. I love the stuff.

As you can see, I only have positive things I can say about this restaurant because it's that great. The food and service is on top so I'm always coming back for more. A member of the wait staff always remembers me when I show up; even after not going there for months! Now that's what I call service. Ok, now my review is really unorganized and I've said way too much. Don't pass up on this amazing place.",2,"good"
