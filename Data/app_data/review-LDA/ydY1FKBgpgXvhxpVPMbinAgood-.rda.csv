"2","I was dragged in here, kicking and screaming. 

Okay, no, not literally. But I should let you know that I was the one who once told all of her friends, ""You will NEVER get me to like raw fish. Never."" So when I received the invitation to eat at Numa, I was fully prepared to plaster a fake smile on my face while forcibly moving my mandibles in a grand show of mastication. By the time i left, I was hooked. 

When walking in, I was greeted with a modern yet welcoming decor, and it made me wish I'd seen the place before the huge renovations. From what I hear, the place has undergone an incredible visual turnaround. The waitresses were lovely and helpful without being swarming or smarmy. Even during the lunch rush, there was none of the harried feeling that sometimes accompanies service when the room becomes filled with hungry customers. 

And on to the most important part - the food. The raw fish was outstanding. I never expected to use that combination of words from the English language, especially about a place that's on the smaller end of the grand scale of sushi eateries, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the owners have invested in truly high grade sushi. For me, that just translates to - ""Om nom nom, is there more, nom nom?"" The salmon melted away into clouds in my mouth, leaving none of the fishy aftertaste that lingers after eating not-so-fresh fish. The toro, which I had for the first time, was torched briefly before being set down on my rice, and it was no less beautiful. We also tried a few of the signature rolls, each seeming to emerge fresher and more beautifully prepared than the last. The vegetables were crisp, the tempura in the cooked pieces were lovely, and the accompanying sauces were perfect, never overpowering and tipping the balance of flavors too much in one direction. The miso soup was standard fare, but arrived nice and hot and rounded out my meal. To top things off, the owners, who were on site during our meal, were a lovely couple and warm and charming to boot. 

We had some young children in our group, whose limited vocabulary precluded them from full participation in this review, but I heard no complaints from them as they ate heartily from their salmon teriyaki bento box. In fact, their chopsticks seemed to travel more often to our plates than their own, and I can think of no higher compliment to any eatery than when kids are happily shkoffing their food. 

Can I say I love sushi now? Will I eat it more often now? I'm a little sorry to say - absolutely not. Because once you have it so great in one place, it sets you up for disappointment when you taste subpar fish elsewhere. 

But even this normally non-sushi lover can wholeheartedly recommend Numa.",1,"good"
"3","I came her for lunch with a friend about a week ago. I was really craving sushi and being new to the city I still have found my sushi spot. I want fresh sushi with variety, and I dont want it to be too expensive.

We went to Numa because it was suggested to us by a stranger I asked on the street. He said that they had good lunch specials.

The decor is simple and elegant and we got a table right away. Not crazy busy for lunch, just quite and a few scattered tables.

The waitress was very sweet and attentive.

I got the lunch special of salmon roll and tuna roll and it comes with miso soup or your choice of a salad. I also got the seaweed salad on top of it. Yummy sushi. But still more then I would like to be spending.

My friend got the sashimi lunch special and a glass of wine. He wasnt able to finish all of it, which I guess is a good sign. I have never heard of too much sushi but he was full. 

Ill come again. Maybe check out the dinner prices.",2,"good"
