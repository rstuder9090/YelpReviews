"2","I have been to Benihana twice.  The first time was in March 2011 for my friend's birthday.  We had a great time and so I decided to sign up for their birthday club, which gives you $30 towards your meal during the month of your birthday, and we went again last week for my birthday. 

This place is definitely better with a group.  Both times we went, it was my husband, my friend, her husband, her 2 1/2 year old son, and myself.  Since we didn't take up a whole table, which seats 8, they fill the seats with strangers, which is fine, but might have been awkward if we weren't in a group.  The other 4 people at our table were 2 couples who were not together, and they all seemed a little shy towards the rest of the table.  Of course the big thing at a place like this is the show.  While the tricks are pretty much the same, both times our chef was pretty good at entertaining us while he cooked our food.  

Anyway, both times I went I ordered the same thing:  the spicy tofu steak.  Most, if not all of the meals, come with the option of plain or chicken fried rice.  Since I am a vegetarian, they made mine veggie fried rice, which the chef was good enough to acknowledge and remember without me even having to tell him after I placed the order with the waitress.  I was also pleased that when I inquired about the onion soup that came with the meal, the waitress not only knew that it was a beef-based broth (you'd be surprised how many waiters/waitresses do not understand that just becuase a soup doesn't have chunks of meat in it doens't mean it is vegetarian), but she also offered me a substitute of the miso soup, which was very good.  All of our meals were also served with a salad with that good Asian ginger dressing.

Becuase my meal did not cost the $30 I was entitled to, the waitress encouraged me to order some apps and side dishes, which I did for our group.  The only thing about the birthday coupon is that it is only good for the person whose birthday it is. And they check ID!  So, I couldn't give it to my husband, whose meal cost a lot more than mine.  

At the end, they bring out a free bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce for the birthday person and sing.  Now, I am not a fan of this.  Unfortunately, becuase you are using the birthday coupon, there is no avoiding it.  But, it's free ice cream, so I'll suck up the embarrassment and eat my ice cream.  It's not too embarrassing though, becuase usually there is at least one birthday person at every table.  That coupon is a big draw!  

They also take your picture with your group, which is a little cheesy, but still cute.  Since the couple we were with are very good friends of ours, and their son is my Godson, I'll take the cheesiness.  

So, in 11 months I went to Benihana twice, both for birthdays.  In the future, I would definitely like to go again, but probably will only go when we have a birthday coupon.  Maybe I'll sign my husband up for his May birthday just for another excuse to go then.",1,"good"
"3","Went around 4 pm and had an early dinner.

The food:

I had the splash and meadow which comes with soup, salad with ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer and onions. The splash and meadow is steak and shrimp. I always order my steak medium well everywhere I go however I have never truly eaten a medium well steak until today.  All of my food was perfectly cooked. Israel, the chef did a great job with the show as well. Put yourself in their shoes and think of how great of a chef you would be here!

My fiance had colossal shrimp and we shared a philly roll and crunchy roll everything was amazing. I really think it was because it was so early however the food is always great here but it was exceptional today.

The service:

I mainly wrote this review because I saw complaints of the service. Even at their worse the service is above and beyond any chain. The waitress asks if you have visited before, reviews specials, and explain the process if it's your first time or you need some guidance.  Also they are refilling your water and soft drinks before you need it so you are never without a drink. Most importamtly, they ask if you need another alcoholic drink and usually have it to you in a few minutes. Their hot green tea is very satisfying after a large meal.  They provide attentive service without being over bearing. If you are celebrating a special occasion they will sing to you with tambourines and will bring our a scoop of ice cream with a candle... mmm green tea ice cream!

I have been here countless times and if you are in the mood for hibachi BENIHANA is your place. I don't understand how other reviews complained about this location. 

Happy Hour:
Also Monday - Thursday? I'm not sure they have happy hour on friday. I believe the hours are 5-7 pm their happy hour specials are definitely worth trying for drinks and sushi. Their sushi is always fresh. This is in the bar area only though. The service at the bar is not equivalent to the service you receive in the main dining area however,  keep in mind they are usually very busy during Happy hour and most times the entire bar area only has two bartenders servicing the restaurant and making drinks for everyone else in the restaurant.",2,"good"
