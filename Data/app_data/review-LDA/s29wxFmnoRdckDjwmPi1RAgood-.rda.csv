After visiting Tokyo just over a year ago, I was ecstatic to find out that there was a place in St. Pete that offered an amazing Omakase experience just like you'll find in Japan. The only problem is that it costs $150 per person, which came out to $192.60 after tax, which is definitely in the top five most expensive meals I've ever had. Because of this, I was a little worried that I'd be able to find someone to go with me, but I got super lucky and my friend who also recently visited Japan jumped on board as soon as I mentioned it to him. So I pre-paid for a party of two online a few days in advance and was all set.

The experience itself was really great. This restaurant was just like the sushi spots we saw in Tokyo -Â very tiny. It's literally a kitchen/prep area and one bar with about 7-10 seats. That's the entire facility. 

We were treated with excellent and authentic Japanese hospitality the entire time. We received 21 courses, but be warned, most of these ""courses"" are literally one bite of different types of Nigiri (in case you're expecting more.) When we were done, I wouldn't say I was hungry, but I also definitely could have eaten a bit more.

As for the quality of the food - it truly was all very good. The only thing I could have done without was the monkfish liver. The texture of that was almost like clay and I didn't love it. But everything else was quite delicious. Standouts were: toro tuna, halibut, striped mackerel, hamachi yellow tail, wagyu beef, eel and the tamagoyaki to finish things off. 

So while the food and service were really superb, I ultimately land on 4-stars because with a glass of wine, my total for the evening was north of $200. And while I don't mind paying top dollar for an amazing meal & experience, I just don't think I could justify that cost again. With that being said, I hope Sushi Sho continues to have great success, as we could absolutely use a place like this in the Bay Area.",1,"good"
"3","This is the best sushi experience you will find in the Tampa Bay Area... don't come here expecting Americanized sushi rolls!  If you want an authentic sushi experience, beyond the average rolls and nigiri that every place else serves, you MUST come to Sushi Sho!!  I lived in Japan for 5 years and this is the only sushi spot I've found in the Tampa Bay area that is truly authentic and dedicated specifically to sushi and sake.  

Friday and Saturday nights are ""Omakase"" only, which is a Japanese word meaning ""chef's choice"" and is a fixed price menu of either $80 or $150 (depending on the quality of sushi you want and length of time you have...the former takes one hour, the latter is two hours).  You're served one piece of sushi at a time, which is meant to be appreciated with your multiple senses.  There are around 2-4 pieces of sushi per course, and in the $80 menu there are 5 courses, which amounted to about 14 delicious bites that complemented each other so well.  I was comfortably full by the end of the meal, but more importantly my senses felt elevated by the end (yes, the sake Omakase helped)!

Rexley himself was there making our sushi and it was a transformational flavor experience (in true Omakase style), beginning with more delicate flavors in the first course, and advancing through sweet/salty flavor profiles, then more savory/herbal flavors, on to delicacies like Uni (sea urchin) and Ikura (salmon roe), and finishing with more robust flavors like Unagi (fresh water eel, which was cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on certain edges and very tender inside with just a dab of his special eel sauce).  We got lucky with our $80 Omakase, because he gave us the higher quality Uni and Scallop from Hokkaido (the best Uni in the world comes from this northern region of Japan), and it was heavenly.  

We also chose to get the $50/person sake tasting, where you get a cup of sake that is paired perfectly with each course (ultimately we had seven glasses of high quality sake and were very tipsy by the end).  I especially appreciated the beautiful hand-made Japanese glass sake cups, which had colors that progressed through each season, beginning with a spring cup inspired by Sakura (cherry blossoms), progressing through colorful summer, orange and gold autumn, and ending with winter... a cloudy and well balanced nigori sake in a beautiful blue and gold sake glass.  Both Omakase courses finish with a glass of plum sake, which was a perfect end to the meal!

Rexley is clearly passionate and committed to the art of traditional sushi!  I truly hope that the good folks of St Pete and the Tampa Bay Area can appreciate this gem and bring him regular business!  This is the sushi place that we need in the Tampa Bay Area!",2,"good"
