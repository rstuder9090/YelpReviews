"2","This unassuming little place in Glassboro, NJ, of all places, is probably now my favorite place to go for Chinese food, now that House of Chen is closed in Chinatown.  I know, bold statement, right?  It's actually Asian fusion, as they have a mega-extensive menu of Chinese and Japanese staples.  I don't eat sushi, but from what I've heard from my co-diners, this place's sushi is very good, and they even have an all-you-can-eat sushi night on Wednesday (I think, unless they've changed their tune recently).  The food is good, the price is right, and the service is outstanding.  It's definitely a treat for those of us stuck living in South Jersey, but with Philly-style tastes.      

This is going to sound stupid:  All of their food is really delish, but my favorite part of going to Tokyo Mandarin - Their white rice.  I swear.  It's just SO good.  I don't know why... it's just the right amount of sticky.  And oh so good.  Mock me if you will, but I purposely order things that come with a side of white rice (most of it does, but I always make sure).

I discovered this place while I attended Rowan back in the day, and I like to venture back every now and then with the BF for some yumness.  For being on a college campus, I've never really seen it super packed, and there's a good mixed demographic in there, not just a bunch of frat kids all the time, so that's nice.  Very cheesey decor, in a good way, and they have cute little booths to one side with pillows and stuff - very Asian-y.  Tokyo Mandarin is definitely a good time.",1,"good"
"3","Another Yelp success story. With a 3 hour wait for a wedding reception, three of us decided to nosh on some light food. But after tasting just one roll, I really wanted to just go for it and order several more.

Lunch specials were offered even on this Saturday, and we all spotted things that appealed to our individual tastes. $8.95 gets you a nice sized entree, with traditional Japanese as well as Thai and Chinese options. And to start we were each served a bowl of very good miso soup.

I had to try at least one roll, and as I said, really would have loved to get more. My selection was difficult, some recognizable choices, but some unique ones as well. Mine was called rock n roll and was a perfectly constructed Maki with shrimp tempura and something else(?) in the middle, on top was avocado, crab and bonito flakes. We all enjoyed it.

My gf ordered shrimp pad Thai, it was good, every ingredient was fresh, and I was surprised that a sushi place could recreate it do well. Our friend picked shrimp in lobster sauce, again very nicely done, I didn't taste but it smelled and looked very good. I had to go Bento box, nice cold salad with the best carrot ginger dressing I've tasted, spicy tuna roll, chicken teriyaki and rice. I enjoyed every bite. Something sweet was required to end such a good lunch, so I suggested green tea ice cream. My companions were not familiar with it and agreed to try. This was possibly the best example of this not too sweet treat I've ever had. Much darker and flavorful than most restaurants serve. We agreed that is was a great way to end.

The decor is very nice, and spotlessly clean, including restrooms. My only regret is that we could not eat more. I can see coming back here and just really hitting the sushi and sashimi hard, but saving room for the perfect GT ice cream. 4.25 let's skip the wedding food and just pig out here Yelps",2,"good"
