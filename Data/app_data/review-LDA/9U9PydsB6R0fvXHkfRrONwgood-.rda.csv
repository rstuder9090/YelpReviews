"2","4 stars for above average sushi, good quality, and a great Pho station. 

Is Kobe's sushi better than Mikado's or Megu's? No. Is Kobe's sushi better than Sushi Kingdom's? You can bet on it, due to the freshness, & how you don't get horrible service here. 

This place is above good enough, compared to other Asian buffets. But it does follow the usual buffet flair: most items are OK quality, and some items are better than others. You will get good value for quality if you go now, because the place is still new. Typically food quality goes down in buffets over time, but you never know if this will be one of them.

So here's the breakdown:

Pro's...
* Many different stations: sushi, salad, fruit & dessert station; big ice cream station; large soup station; Hibachi & Pho station where they cook in front of you; American food station with pizza, fries, etc; multiple other stations featuring mainstream Asian items as well as more ""ethnic"" items; and a few specialty seafood items such as baked salmon and sea bass.
* Service was consistently good throughout all visits. Our plates were promptly removed, and our drinks were refilled at least once, as opposed to other places I won't mention.
* Like I said, some items are worth trying more than others. My faves are: the seaweed salad, hot & sour soup; salmon or sea bass; the potstickers (when crispy); the pho with seafood, curry broth and yellow egg noodles (very authentic), crab legs (dinner only), coffee ice cream, and their p√¢te a choux pastry (when available). I will say that the pho is so good, I could just come for that alone!
*On weekends, you'll find better service and freshness of foods overall. It gets pretty packed on Sat. & Sun.

Con's...
*Aside from the servers, everyone else working here seems to have a hard time with speaking English. I couldn't get any help anytime I asked for it around the restaurant.
*As with any buffet, any food under a hot lamp for over 20min will show a drop in quality. 
* Some of the items are undoubtedly from a bag, and any experienced foodie can tell by looking at the stuff.
* Any coupons that are expired (even from 1 day ago) will not be honored.
* Some of the items are just plain bad (ex: their pizza; their ice creams are definitely lacking flavor (ex: their green tea ice cream does NOT taste of green tea).

So I say check it out because for the variety and quality you pay for, you really can't go wrong with trying it out.",1,"good"
"3","I feel like I am just constantly seeing these Chinese seafood buffets up their game and this was no exception, raising the bar for buffets everywhere.

First of all, it's big and pretty. You're greeted with one of those waterfall-wall fountain-fixture things. With lights. Real pretty. There is SO MUCH food. There's a noodle and dim sum bar in the back, where you can make your own custom bowl of noodles. (ZOMG) There are 6 bars of food - seafoods, American food, fried foods, etc. There is a soup bar with TEN DIFFERENT SOUPS, a few of which are great Chinese dessert soups. There's the giant salad bar with SO MUCH DELICIOUS SUSHI and some great-looking desserts. And of course, a freezer full of ready-to-scoop ice cream and sherbet.

Second, the price is right. $13 for dinner for adults? That's fantastic for how much food there is and the quality that they're offering. Let me just run down some of the food I got:

- Fresh raw oysters - Definitely quite fresh, and you can easily get your money's worth from your meal just by getting these
- Snow crab legs - Okay I didn't get a chance to eat these because a) more work than I like to deal with when shoveling food into my mouth but also b) there was consistently a huge line waiting to snatch up a plate full of them. They would disappear fast
- Ginger scallion lobster
- SO MUCH SUSHI you don't even know and it was all so delicious
- SOUPS like taro soup, sweet red bean soup (dessert soups) and egg drop soup but also Maryland crab soup? DANG YO.
.... okay you get the idea? They take it to the NEXT LEVEL Y'ALL.

My only gripe would be about the fruit offered, but there was so much it was a miracle I was even able to eat any fruit afterwards. I was really wow-ed by the options available at this buffet. I can see why my dad dragged us here even though it's not on the way from my old home in Edison to my new home in Maryland.

ALSO our servers were super duper nice!",2,"good"
