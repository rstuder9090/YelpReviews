"2","So the price for the buffet is a little deceiving. I saw ""All you can eat sushi for $20.99 for dinner"" and I thought 'Wow. What a great deal.""  But actually, they have 3 levels that you can choose from and the prices go up depending on what level you choose. Level 1 is $20.99 but has basic rolls and some appetizers. Most of the specialty rolls (including rainbow and spider, etc.) are in Level 3 and cost $30.99 for dinner. It's still a good price if you get mostly specialty rolls since if you buy them separately, it would definitely cost most, but still deceiving since most buffets are one price for dinner. Also, the buffet is only Monday through Thursday. 

FYI, the buffet isn't one where the rolls are premade and you go up and choose from the bunch. You place your order with the waiter and they bring it out to you when it's made, which means that that rolls are fresh. 

I had read reviews that the service is slow at peak times so we went in for an early dinner. When we went, there was only one other person in the restaurant so the service was pretty fast. But the place started to fill up as we were wrapping up our meal so I can see how the wait can get long since when we were there was only 1 sushi chef and someone helping with the toppings/sauces. 

The place itself was very cute and the waiter and the girl helping with the sushi were very friendly.  

As for the food, the rolls were some of the best that I've had.  My friend and I were saying 'This roll is REALLY good.' after each one that we tried!  The sushi and the veggies in the rolls were very fresh- especially the avocado! I can't remember what all the rolls were but we ate a lot of the rolls in Level 3 and they were all very delicious. The ones that stand out in my memory are the AK47, Sunrise, Blue O and Cheeseburger (I was a bit skeptical about a Cheeseburger roll because it kinda sounded gross- sushi and cheeseburgers don't seem like they mix. But we couldn't get over how the Cheeseburger tasted just like a cheeseburger and it was actually really good!)

When we were finished eating, the waiter brought over a La Flama Blanca Roll and asked if we wanted it. He cautioned us that the chef had made it extra spicy because he accidentally put extra sauce on it.  The AK-47 was listed with 2 bombs in hotness and it wasn't hot at all, but the La Flama Blanca Roll was listed as 3 and let me tell you, I'm not sure if it's because it's the spiciest roll on the menu or because of the extra hot sauce but that roll was SPIC-Y!!!! I couldn't eat more than 3 of the rolls because it was so spicy! It seriously was too spicy to enjoy- I can't even remember what else was in the roll. All I can remember is that it was hot! Who know, maybe it's better with less sauce on it.",1,"good"
"3","tried this last week after hearing a few nice things. very much like!! i am a very unfussy sushi fan. i like simple rolls, casual atmosphere, and quality ingredients. this place really hit the spot. 

we made it for half price happy hour and sampled quite a few dishes. i think the agedashi tofu and the takoyaki were my favorites. the tofu was light and flavorful with bits of bonito and onion. the takoyaki were like little fried balls of octopus custard. YUM. tempura was thinly breaded with a good selection of veggies - asparagus, shiitake, pumpkin, sweet potato. seaweed salad was fine. nothing special, but a nice balance for all our fried stuff. like the calamari, which was EXCELLENT if a bit salty (friends didn't seem to mind). breaded in panko, with a little bit of heat, they came out looking like onion rings, but inside they were just the right tenderness. they were probably everyone else's fave. 

we ordered a pair of rolls, too. we got one california - lovely and pillowy and soft - and, upon request, yellowtail with scallion, my favorite.  it's hard to screw it up, but somehow easy to disappoint it the fish/rice/scallion are at all lacking in quality. this is probably the best execution i have had here in the city. cool & smooth tuna with slight bite & tang to the rice with a strip of clean green onion. i was super pleased with their roll. i will absolutely go back and order one of these every single time. A++ 

it was hot as heck in there - maybe something wrong with the AC? - and an automatic air freshener kept spraying cologne smell across our table, but they were apologetic about both. 

nice & attentive staff. and cool tea infusing contraptions if you order hot tea. 

with the half price happy hour we made out like full-bellied bandits. next time i'm going to make it for $1 nigiri night. 

overall, i think this is my new favorite sushi spot. quality stuff & casual enough that you can have a sushi night in absence of a special occasion to excuse the outrageous bill.",2,"good"
"4","If there are any Blue Ocean lovers out there, I hate to tell you this, but our experience was interesting... and not in a good way. And I'm not just a sushi snob ... I actually really wanted to say good things about Blue Ocean because I've been there a few times and have always enjoyed the food. In fact, the food was pretty good last night. However, there were just a few things that threw me off about this particular experience.

Perhaps the meal was jinxed from the start, because it started with a vanishing act. What do I mean, you ask? Well, Blue Ocean Sushi used to be across from Thai Pizza on the Loop. However, when I arrived at that location, I was shocked to find that Blue Ocean Sushi was nowhere to be found! There was a new, different sushi place there and I was very confused. Was I crazy? No. Blue Ocean had relocated (without informing me?! what?!). In case you were wondering, they are now near the FroYo (which served us well when we inevitably wanted dessert after dinner).

Anywho, once we finally found the place, the four of us sat down around a crowded table (my back was semi-pinned against a wall) and looked over the menu. The menu had a nice variety of sushi rolls and nigiri and a large assortment of sake. Plus, Tuesdays are $1 sake shot nights at Blue Ocean and since the waitress pretty much forced us to get them, we did.

The girls and I ordered spring rolls and edamame to chase our sake and mulled over the menu. And here's where the trouble starts. While we were mulling, we happened to notice a man calm his girlfriend's frantic heart by smashing a pretty good-sized bug that was crawling across the wall. Now, I grew up on a farm and live in an older building... so bugs don't freak me out too much--but, that being said, in a restaurant they are unwelcome patrons. Because we were starving (probably because it took us 30 minutes to find the place), we brushed off the bug-siting and ordered.

We decided to go with the ""Frank Sinatra Set"" which consisted of any two Special Rolls and any two Regular Rolls for $25. We went with a Spicy Tuna Avacado Roll, a Crunch Roll, the Beechy Roll, and the Cardinal Roll (to start). While we waited, our spring rolls and edamame arrived. Both were very good--particularly the spring rolls.

Of course, it was hard to focus on the food when another (rather good-sized) bug made its appearance--this time on our table. No, scratch that, it didn't just make an appearance, it made an entrance. It fell from the sky and *plop* landed right on our table. Bug sighting number two... we started to feel a little more uncomfortable.

But, not wanting to waste our Groupon, we decided to continue the meal. As we munched on edamame and chatted, we noticed that it took a surprisingly long amount of time for the sushi to arrive--and when it did our waitress (rather unapologetically) told us that the ""crunch"" that was supposed to top our Crunch Roll was not done cooking, so they had brought it out without it. AKA we were given a regular California roll which was somewhat disappointing.

Chopsticks in hand, we dug in. The special rolls were much better than the regular rolls, probably because they are covered with eel sauce and filled with delicious things like cream cheese (oh calories, you taste so good!). The Beechy roll was sweet (I'd bet the mango in it had something to do with that) and the Cardinal roll was nice and savory. Needless to say, the sushi was gone in an instant and we decided to order more.

At that point, the only real issue was finding our waitress to place another order. Service was pretty slow--though it didn't seem like there were that many people in the restaurant. Eventually we had to ask another waitress for menus.

Once we finally did get a menu, we decided on the Spider and Dragon rolls. They arrived about as promptly as the first rolls had, but they were pretty good. We all agreed that the first round of special rolls was better than the second... The Dragon roll was decent (but not super memorable), but the Spider roll (which had some fried crab in it) was just a little too warm for our liking.

All of that being said, one of the perks of the meal was our bill; it was only $92! Now, $92 may seem expensive; but for sushi (and for enough food for four people) that is good. I mean, we had a combined 6 rolls, 2 appetizers, 4 beers, and 4 shots. So, I'd say we did pretty good ringing it at under $100.

As we signed the check and finished our drinks, we couldn't help but notice another bug on the table next to ours. Three bugs in an hour and a half is rather unsettling. Honestly, I tried really hard to attribute the bugs to the new space... Perhaps they hadn't quite gotten around the bug bombing the place--but the damage was done, we were grossed out. Bugs in a restaurant are unacceptable.

All in all, the service was iffy and I may have potentially eaten a bug or two; so, even though the food was pretty good and the price was great, I don't plan on returning.",1,"bad"
"5","I read about this place in the newest Sauce magazine and I was so jazzed to come here. All you can eat sushi?!? Hell yeah! I got together a group of friends (9 to be exact), and made reservations for us.

We get there and the table is not set up for us, even though we called to confirm. Meh, that's fine. We didn't have to wait long. We sat down, but they didn't have enough menus to go around. We had to share three menus for a group of nine people. That's something that's never happened to me at a restaurant. But I'm okay with it, still drooling at the prospect of all you can eat sushi.

We ordered drinks, which took forever to come. We all got water eventually, but the sodas and teas took at least 20 minutes to come. Twenty minutes for DRINKS? Hmmmm..... We order our sushi, and then we waited. And waited. I get that it takes time. Sushi takes a minute, and it's all made to order. It just seemed like if they are going to go all you can eat, maybe they should employ more sushi chefs to keep up with the volume that people will surely be ordering? 

In the time we waited for the sushi to come we all got a little more peckish and ordered some veggie tempura and Crab Rangoon, which thankfully came out rather quickly. It was good, and kept us from eating our napkins. Then the sushi finally came and it was.... Eh. My salmon skin roll kept sticking in my teeth, which I've never had that happen before. It was rubbery. The Nigiri was decent. I really liked the albacore. My friends that had the specialty rolls said they were pretty good. I did snag one of my friends ""Cheeseburger Rolls"" (their signature roll) and I thought it was pretty gross. Mustard and ketchup in a sushi rolls? Eck. 

We order round two, more Nigiri for me, and again WAITED. Like I said, I know it takes time but jeez, did it take time. Our waitress was less than attentive. More than twice I had to ask for more water and another glass of wine. But eventually more sushi can and we all gorged ourselves silly. Finally we asked for the check. A gratuity charge had been added to our bill, which is normal for large parties. But they added a 20% charge. Most places it's 18%.  We all didn't think we received 20% tip service, but whatever. I think she neglected our table because she knew she'd be getting a nice tip anyway. 

We all pay, most with a card, but a few with cash. She brings our cards back, and the cash change for our cash paying friends. Cash change, but no coin. My boyfriend's bill was $17.77 and he paid with a twenty. She brought him back $2, not the $2.23 he deserved back. Now, I've seen this done at bars when bar tenders are really swamped and don't have the time to count out change. This is not my favorite practice. I know it's only a few cents, but it is MY change. Penny saved, penny earned and all that. I let it go at bars because the bar tenders really are swamped but I have never, ever seen it done at a restaurant. My boyfriend was a little ticked. He had received sub par service from this waitress all night, we gave her a mandatory 20% tip, and now she's keeping his change? 

He politely asks for his 23 cents. She stares at him, and said it takes too much time to count out change and they just round it out. He simply looks at her, she rolls her eyes and says she'll get the change. She comes back, hands it to him, and with a healthy dose of attitude says that they do not usually do this, and will not do it the next time we come back. We say that it won't be a problem, because we will NOT be coming back. 

All in all, okay sushi, bad service, and they steal your change. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and will not be coming back.",2,"bad"
