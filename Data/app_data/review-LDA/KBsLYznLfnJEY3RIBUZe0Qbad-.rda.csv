Yelp 25 % off ayce with yelp check in, score!!!!

The inside is so pretty and well decorated, and I love the location! It's so so so close to my condo, and traders Joe's where I shop.

So after mom and I went to traders we squeezed in during the last 30 minutes till close, and they were totally cool about it. I recognized the owner from the carson location in the back.

The rolls omg just that perfect thin layer to cover but not over shadow the seaweed and fish, stick and sweet and tangy (rice white vinegar and sugar, held together seamlessly on all the rolls.

Mom ordered the Fuji and said the raw fish was some of the freshest she has had anywhere local, including minatio and hinko. The shrimp inside had a lovely crunch with out being too oily.

I order three rolls and loved the presentation on all of them as well as the spicy level.

The cici with no salmon (they were totally cool about it too) had wicked hot white sauce on it spicier than sriracha, but I loved it!!! The scallops were super fresh and the other tangy sauce paired nicely with the ripe avocado and the cream cheese was a needed to balance out the spice level. 

The moon dog poppers had crunch jalape√±o with the seeds taken out so it was much less spicy than the other roll, paired well with spicy crab and a crispy tempura case, and cream cheese filled innards.

Then the two next rolls were sooooo artistically done both my mom and I were taken back. Plated on craved wood the sauce designs were truly magical as you can see in the pictures!!! 

The volcano had the delicately fried out side, and was pipping hot, with the soft eggy sweet tamago inside and huge sweet scallops on top with a spice sauce and sauce all around the plate to drag through. 

The samurai was prob my fav. The huge chunks of pecans were such a lovely bit of nutty texture, to the cream cheese and fluffy fried shrimp, topped with again huge chunky scallops and black sesame seeds with 2 creamy spice sauces. Then again plated like a a piece from a museum!!

I can't not wait to go back and try more of the unique rolls and see the art they dish up.",1,"good"

As much as I love the buffet in the Atlantis, a change of pace was in order!  So on my last work visit to Reno I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and plugged in 'sushi'.  Kei Sushi was literally less than 2 miles from my hotel...and with great ratings!  I figure, well...with my per diem maxing out at about $25 for dinner, why not!!?

Upon arriving at Kei Sushi, even for a weeknight it was fairly busy.  I managed to get a nice, quite table near the back of the restaurant.  Service was still great throughout though, my server was attentive and back to me often with refills of drinks as well as sushi!

The AYCE runs $24.95 for dinner and you get run of the entire menu!  And boy...did I take full advantage of that!  I stuffed my gills silly with plate after plate of gourmet Japanese!  Here's an entire rundown of everything I savored:

-Rooster Salmon - salmon topped with lemon, pickled jalapeno, and spicy krab
-Kei Tuna (torched) - seared tuna with special crystal mix, scallop sauce, sriracha, and teriyaki
-Salmon Lover - salmon, scallop sauce, pickled jalapeno, salmon skin, and green onion
-Fire Ball - tuna topped with spicy tuna, fried onions, and teriyaki
-Quail Egg Shooter (delicious!) - quail egg, ponzu, sriracha, sesame seeds, green onion, and tobiko
-Macho Macho (hand roll) - crystal shrimp, spicy krab, cream cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, cilantro, and sriracha
-Iris (hand roll) - tempura shrimp, asparagus, and green onion topped with avocado, lemon, cilantro, and spicy krab
-Spider - tempura soft shell crab, cucumber, carrots, red tobiko, and mild sauce
-Blossom (baked) - crystal shrimp, and cream cheese topped with salmon, house sauces, and panko
-Fuji Mountain (hand roll) - crystal shrimp, and spicy mayo topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and spicy krab
-Optimus - shrimp and krab egg roll, and pickled jalapeno topped with seared tuna, avocado, lemon, and marinated red onion

That was a TON of food for just me!!  The great thing about Kei Sushi is that if you want to try a particular creation but don't want an entire long roll, they will make it into an individual hand roll!  They do this for all their specialty rolls except the ones that are fried or baked.

But I wasn't done yet!  Kei Sushi does something I haven't seen before, dessert sushi rolls!  Yes!  I tried:

-OMG -  tamago, cream cheese, and pecans, deep fried with a mix of panko, almonds, cinnamon, and coconut - topped with honey & chocolate

OMG indeed!  Not only was the dessert roll different, it was tasty too!  Actually, everything I had was delicious!  The fish was fairly fresh, served at the right temperature, and good serving sizes.  The rice was cooked very well too, not soggy or over sticky.

Even after all that, I finished the night with a serving of green tea ice cream.  I couldn't help myself!  I really packed it all in, I was saving calories all day just to splurge on dinner!  Totally worth it!

Next time I'm back in town for work - Kei Sushi is on my list of good eats!",2,"good"
"4","I was stoked to try this place! I love the idea of all you can eat sushi esp places like Sushi Pier. That being said, Im from San Francisco and definitely have a love for good sushi and great combinations of flavor for sushi rolls. Found Kei had great reviews (although only at a mere 100 reviews) and wanted to give the new place a try.

The restaurant ambience, cleanliness, and staff were fine--met expectations for a standard suburban restaurant. That being said, the place was dead--definitely more employees than customers to say the least.

The AYCE food--Overall: Dont bother. 

Nitty Gritty:

Miso soup: too salty--they put in raw mushrooms to top it off. Not a norm and tasted raw because it was just dumped carelessly on top.

Sunomuno: skip--made with celery instead of nice tiny slices of cucumber.

Ceviche: OK. Get it only if you really feel like ceviche.

Tempura: Saddest tempura dish ever. The batter is NOT Japanese style tempura, but more like, cheap/carnival deep fried foods fried. Only 3 pieces were served--not normal of a vegetable tempura order. They were also covered in teriyaki sauce. When we asked about tempura sauce, the waitress hadn't a clue what that even was or why what was served was out of the ordinary. Dear Kei--You never serve tempura with teriyaki sauce!

Baked mussles: Not enough flavoring in sauce or sauce itself. Hard to mess up but ya kinda did.

All Rolls: Nice enough presentation but...I cannot stress enough how bland all the rolls are. It is as if someone from middle America decided to copy what sushi rolls should look like on a plate but not bother tasting it. If your palate prefers simple and natural flavors or foods covered randomly in teriyaki sauce this might be acceptable for you. Almost everything has cream cheese or has some kind of 'mix' that consists of a bland mix of imitation crab. 

Hand rolls: MAKE EVERYTHING INTO A HAND ROLL. Honestly the only passable food in this place was a long roll converted to a hand roll. I'm not sure if it is because the hand rolls have the ingredients more mixed and less spread out to allow it to be bland or what not--but the hand rolls are the only way to go.

Dessert: Eh. They do dessert rolls which sound like a good idea. But then you find out they really wrap it with sushi rice and seaweed.. skip it. It's so unauthentic Im not even going to try. Believe it or not they mess up their Vanilla ice cream as well by providing a like-ice cream substitute..so don't order the vanilla ice cream either. 

Now I'm not trying to be pretentious here. I just wanted a good meal and I wanted to like Kei. But gosh this place was sad and unfulfilling. How is it possible to have had such unauthentic food--just another Sushi Pier copycat. Really this place probably deserves one star but the place was very clean and tries to look trendy which I appreciate so +1. 

Skip this place if you're looking for something worth the calories though. I'm going to Sonic instead.",1,"bad"
"5","So this is not my 1st time to have an issue at Kei Sushi. I keep trying because it is right in my backyard and I LOVED the Rooster Roll. 

So first let me say that I am trying to have extra patience due to Covid. Hell I am trying not to go out into things as much as possible but sushi...That may be worth the risk once in a while. We need to mitigate but we need to live too or the virus has already killed us and it does not matter. Wear masks and make sure you wash hands before you eat and after you leave...Make sure the establishment is adhering to caution as best they can or do not go there.

So first I will say that they are REALLY doing the Covid caution and kudos. BUT that is where things stop being good. 

1. First thing in the door we were seated and about 10 minutes later the gal came up for drink orders. By this point I am a little worried but ok...Covid! Then I realized that she had not even presented wasabi and I had to ask if that was a new thing due to the virus and she offered to get some...Ok Covid...right?!...

2. She came back several minutes later with the drinks and said she'd be right back. And she was...about 10 minutes later. There were 4 tables at a total person count of about 7 or 8 people. OK! Covid? We placed our aps and several rolls on order which I felt was treated as an imposition but if I am going to wait 30 min every time I order...well...And I was reserved in my ordering under that feeling.

So we got the best part of that order about 15 or 20 minutes later and when delivered I noticed I did not have my muscles. I asked if she still had those coming and she said she would check on that. I also asked if I could put in a few more items so we could have them ready when we finished what we had without taking up the table for too long. She said she'd be right back! And 15 minutes later after folding some menus and refilling some drinks while 2 other people folded the menus and played with a table...possibly training? At the dinner onset? 

Mkay Beyond Covid...Bad service and controls period.

Finally 45 minutes after ordering them I got my muscles! Awesome! You guys had to have broken some fingers speeding through the prep! I can practically see the fire coming off your shoes...And the hands of the 2 girls playing with the menus still and chatting about the workplace politics! Yup pretty sure this place is frikin done now. WTH???!

Fortunately we got the 2nd part of our order 30 minutes after submitting it. I quietly completed it and a staff member that actually cared about customer service came up all friendly and asked if we had everything and I asked for the check. At this point I had 1 roll, the Japaican, which was the worst and was something I had forgotten I hated or it was some sort of revenge for being alive served up by the same cook that sent me out the room temp, dry, chewy Tiger and the Kei Tuna...Done with all lack of love and left to sit as i watched for at least 10-15 minutes while everyone seemed more interested in talking. There were 2 more tables by this point and surely the catalyst of such terrible sushi and service...Or was it a complete lack of care by the staff. The cook never tried to rush them even once since calling the order. He was happy to let it sit too...GREAT!

Anyway I was nearly finished when I sent the nice gal for the check. Our waitress returns no check in hand to tell me that I would have to pay for unfinished sushi. I told her that I was finishing the whole thing (about 6 pieces of Nigiri) excluding the Japaican because it was the nastiest thing I had ever tried. The sauce was the taste and consistency of vomit...Colour and all. To which she said ok and scurried off to get my check. 

I checked to see if I would be charged for the Japaican and I had finished the rest so there was no reason to be rude in the first place unless she was feeling defensive enough to punish me. Especially since you could look at my face and see my disgust with the whole experience, sushi, service, speed...Fortunately that would be less than necessary...For if you listened to the din of other customers complaining about the same things all about us and well spaced out so obviously (none of us were feeling the need to keep such things secret nor private) you would be able to target the issues with the evening and improve on them easily...Or do what they all were doing and ignore adversity! In any case they decided not to charge me and that was a good choice as it would have been the raindrop that broke the dam. We paid and left and agreed we were now officially done with the place.

Previously some friends got bad miso and got sick...But that is fermented so... I now see that the place has a sickness. At best they are pissing us all off. Worst they are exhibiting stunning neglect. Neglect is bad but also dangerous.

We arrived into this establishment at 310pm. We left at 520pm. Dear Gods!
Done! BYE FELICIA!",2,"bad"
