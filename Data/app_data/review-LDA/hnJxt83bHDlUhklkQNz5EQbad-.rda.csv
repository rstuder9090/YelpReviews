"2","I feel like I should always preface my reviews for Japanese restaurants with a disclaimer - I work in quality control for a living, and I used to live in Japan, so bear that in mind when you read my reviews for these kinds of restaurants, LOL!

Wasabi is really not bad at all. Although they have effed up my to-go order every. single. time.... but I can't complain b/c the 'mess-ups' were delicious ones, so it wasn't a big deal or anything. 

Tried their chirashi. It was tasty but seems really overpriced considering the amount you get. It kinda pales in comparison to Fin's but Fin is much farther away, so I am willing to pay the extra amount...I just imagine it as the equivalent to what I'd pay in gasoline driving to some other restaurant where the chirashi is slightly cheaper and you get more for your money. At least, though, they will sub out any squid/octopus (I have issues with the texture of those) with masago/ikura for no extra charge. I wish the chirashi came with nori furikake though! And extra pickled ginger and other pickled stuff. Mmm that would be so good. I am getting hungry just typing this, bahaha!

They had uni last time I was in but I was too nervous to try it, worried it wouldn't be good. Uni can be kinda hit or miss, even at places where I have had top notch uni before. Plus the value of Uni from Bob's Seafood is unbeatable!! *Uni Lust!!*

I love their green tea here and I love how it is served. Hard to explain, you just have to see it in action!!

My companion typically gets their chicken teriyaki dinner. I tried some. It wasn't bad but hella sugary, and the rice tasted like it had a gallon of butter dropped on it. Not my thang. But he seemed to enjoy it! 

Their maki rolls are pretty good too although, again, hella dolllaaaz. I think I am becoming a cheapass as I get older, LOL. I like to get some every once in a while, but I could not afford to eat here weekly. Perhaps I should try their happy hour as I have heard good things about it and it  seems more affordable that way. I am dying to try the fried lobster roll. Mmmm!!! I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they have soba noodles here, served COLD as they should be (in my book anyway.) I also like that they have all the right toppings. Shit, I think I may need to go call in an order of soba noodles now, agghhhh! Don't Yelp on an empty stomach, peoples!!

The staff here are really nice and I've had pleasant exchanges both on the phone ordering to-go and also in person. I've only been in once to sit and eat dinner, but it was a good experience. I just wish their property management/building company/whatever would allow them to install some kind of a antechamber type of thing in the front b/c when it's 7 degrees outside and you are seated at the front of the restaurant, and another customer opens the door to come inside, a BLAST of icy air shoots in and it can be overwhelmingly chilly for a bit before the cold dissipates. Had even asked them about it and they said they weren't allowed to do that b/c the building company said it would be ""aesthetically unpleasing."" Lol wow. Well good thing it's not winter year-round here, or that would be a serious cockblock when trying to enjoy one's dinner. 

Also apparently Yelp will deliver food from this place (""EAT24 App"") to your house, but I think there is a fee of $7? Or maybe it was $10? I forget!! But that's an option now, apparently. Also according to the manager's comment below, GrubGo.com will deliver for a minimum fee of $3 (it goes up based on how far away you live from the restaurant.) But there is a minimum order of $15, just as an FYI.",1,"good"
"3","I eat at the Town & Country Wasabi very regularly. I was out in St. Charles on a Tuesday running a work errand and decided to give this Beale Street location a try since was dinner time and I was hungry and right there. I walked in and asked for a table for 1. This really perplexed the hostess. She made me wait about 5 minutes for a table even though there were roughly 9 empty tables. If you've been here you know this is a smallish place and they probably only have about 20 tables total so they were half empty. She was mentioning to someone else that one of the tables had a reservation over an hour away. I'm a single diner. I'm going to eat and leave...not linger. After I finally got sat the service from my waitress was lovely and the food was great just like the Town & Country location. I ordered one Clayton Roll (Crunch mix and cucumber topped with seared tuna, fajita pepper, and eel sauce), one Spicy Omega Roll (Spicy salmon and shrimp tempura, topped with tuna, avocado, and sweet chili sauce), and one Playboy Roll (Spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, topped with salmon, avocado, and wasabi trio sauce.) I managed to finish :-).  The hostess needs a lesson in being a hostess. It gives someone a first impression and my first impression was not favorable. Turns out everything else made up for it.",2,"good"
"4","Came in for a dinner on a Friday night. I have to say that I should have made a reservation because it was pretty crowded. With that said, this visit was extremely disappointing, and I don't know if I would ever come back due to this. As you can tell, I specifically made a profile just to post my disappointment. First, I was greeted by a really crabby host. I get it's a busy Friday night, but it's a little unacceptable to treat your customers with a rude demeanor. I asked for how long of a wait time for a booth seating. The host kinda mumbled a little, and then just ran off towards the dining area, while the other host just stared at me looking lost. Turned out he went to clean a booth for us. There were 4 of us, with that in mind he sat us on a quite small booth. We asked for a bigger space, but we were told ""as you can see, we're quite busy, there's along wait for a bigger table."" Kinda a smart comment, but we were quite hungry, so we just agreed to sit there begrudgingly. 

We waited for a bit, and no one stopped by to simply greet us, or give us some water while waiting. We looked around while other tables were filling up, and finally our server stopped by. The most unprofessional looking server we've ever had. Weird thing, she was dressing differently than the rest of them. Looked so out of place, when everyone is dressing up in a very formal uniform, black shirts, and red ties, she was barely bothered to wear some t-shirt and a loose cardigan, and we can literally smell the rancid wet cigarette odor as she's telling us how her day has been so hectic, and how the chefs are being so slow, etc etc. Thanks for the life story lady, we just wanted something to drink. There's nothing wrong with a friendly chatty server, but the cigs smell, the wait for some water, and the excessive heating just made us so cranky. We ordered some drinks, and that took a while. When she came back, she proceeded to pull a pen out of her bun top, and then just kept moving and fidgeting around while talking to us, just couldn't stay still. Again, we were just cranky, but the way she's talking to us really bothered us. Her tone, almost like she's scolding us and just sounded so unfriendly and patronizing, especially with her excessive hand movements. It was literally just things on top of things on top of things that were bothering us about her. 

Carry on, she proceeded to take our orders. About 15-20 minutes later, our appetizers showed up. Then we waited for about 15-20 more minutes, and our food hadn't arrived yet. She stopped by after we finished our appetizers, and she tried to give us some estimated time for our dinner. Again, her tone... she then disappeared for a bit, until when she dropped off our meals. As she came closer to our table, you can literally tell that she was coming because of the lingering cigarette smell. It felt like we were eating at a bar. As she was putting our plates down, that's when we smelled something else that didn't smell like cigarette. I let you use your own imaginations on what it was. She asked if we wanted another round of drinks, and we politely refused. We just didn't know how long it would be for them. We just wanted to finish our dinner and leave. 

I know this review looks like it's just an angry rant on our server, but I promise you, I'm usually a very understanding person when it comes to our servers when we're dining out, but lady needs either a retraining or a write up from higher management. From her appearance, to the way she talks to the customers, to the wait time for our food, to the lingering odors, we just couldn't wait until we got out of there. Our food was quite delicious. One criticism, the tempura was quite soggy, not crunchy enough. Tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. We weren't asked by our server if we wanted any dessert, so we just asked for our bill. She brought our bills to us, and proceeded to walk away, while dirty plates were still on our table. Umm isn't that a part of the service? Is that too much to ask, to constitute the tips? The restrooms were also in need of a closer attention. It smelled like the sewer was backed up. One of us actually almost slipped on the hallway leading to the restrooms. It looked filthy, greasy and hasn't been cleaned for a while.

Food 3.5*, wait time 3*, cleanliness 3.5* service 1*(0* if we want to be particulate considering the poor ""service"" we received that night.) Management, take notes. Look at some of your reviews here. There's an ongoing running theme here. The service is quite sub par. It's severely lacking compared to the place next door. It's never my intention to get the server fired, but she's in dire need of some training. I walked past the other server on my way out, she told us to have a great the rest of the night. Best service I received that night, and she wasn't even our server. Thank you lady(I forgot to catch her name, but I think she's the only Japanese one there? Correct me if I'm wrong.)",1,"bad"
"5","I am giving 2 stars because the in-restaurant service has been exemplary. However, delivery has been consistently and exceptionally bad. I'm not a Karen and this set of experiences just sucked. Please take note Yelpers...

Each time I've asked for delivery, there's been something wrong and never once has it been the delivery driver. Each time, it's a late order, a mistaken item, or a missed item. This last experience resulted in the driver calling me to mention that he had been waiting for 35 minutes, the place was a mess, and he wasn't sure when he'd have our family's Friday night dinner. Mind you, I committed to tipping the driver 25% already, so he was operating from a position of support and clearly, I'm not a Karen.

I called the restaurant and the person answering the phone said they were slammed and had no idea why the timing in the app was mistaken. I explained (kindly, I might add) that we were supposed to have our delivery 25 minutes ago and were told by the driver (not the app or the restaurant) that it would be another 30 minutes or more to get this to us. The restaurant hostess (I think) shared that there was only one order ahead of ours and then our driver would be on his way. She expressed there was expedience to get it out the door.

The driver was texting us back that the restaurant was a mess and that he wasn't sure what would happen. Should he wait? I offered to tip him well if he waited for multiple reasons, namely because COVID-19 and also we are having the worst rebound in infections St. Charles right now, so I was exceptionally thankful for his commitment. This is aside from the rain that was supposed to start soon. 

Our driver, Steven, texted us he was on his way and an hour and twenty minutes late, he was en route. I tipped him $20 extra for his horrific experience as a driver and thanked him profusely. I then inventoried our order and yup... we were missing food. 

This is the third time this has happened during delivery. I contacted Grubhub and asked for the manager of the restaurant to contact me. They refunded the missing item and closed the chat. Ugh. No more Grubhub and no more Wasabi until a few things happen:

#1 - Grubhub manages their relationships with vigor. Why order from a delivery service unless they own the experience. As customers, we don't pay for output. We pay for outcomes. 
#2 - The manager of Wasabi calls and apologizes for consistent shit service related to our experiences and she or he (Wasabi manager) makes an overture to change our desire to engage in their restaurant service again. I can get near Wasabi-quality sushi through a neighboring restaurant without the delivery problems. Admittedly,the neighboring sushi isn't as good, but it shows up on time and right every damned time.

As committed to Grubhub for their desire to not engage, I deleted their app. As committed here, I will vote with my dollar and won't order from Wasabi until they address their quality issue and my experience directly.",2,"bad"
