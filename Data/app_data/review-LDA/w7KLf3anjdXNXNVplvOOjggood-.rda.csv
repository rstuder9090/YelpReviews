"2","I have been going to Sushi Tsu since before it moved to it's current location.  It is my go to restaurant for sushi in New Tampa.  They always have fresh, delicious sushi each and every time I have been there; and I have been there probably more than 100 times since I have been in Tampa.  

      The consistency with which they provide excellent sushi is what makes it a GREAT place to eat.  I would not hesitate in recommending this place to anyone looking for good sushi.

    The hibachi grill experience is also enjoyable; my wife and I mainly go with the kids for some onion volcano excitement.

Also, not neglecting some of the lesser known menu items: We love the Gyoza(pan fried dumplings) and Hot udon noodle soup with various accompaniments.  Having my self been to Japan 17 times over the years, I can tell you that Sushi Tsu most accurately reflects the look and taste of the food I eat  there much more so than many other local  Japanese restaurants. 

I hope this gives you a little push to go ahead and try Sushi Tsu. I do not think you will regret it.",1,"good"

Sushi Tsu has been my all time FAVE restaurant in New Tampa, but my last trip there...???? What happened?? They really dropped the ball!! My daughters dinner was missing half the food that came with it and we had to wait for them to cook it.. Service was a dodgy as  well.  Certainly not the standard we've come to expect there.I'd like to chalk this experience up to them just having an off day. Hopefully things will be as good as they've always been in the past when we return again.",2,"good"
