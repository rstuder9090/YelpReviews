"2","Whoa, 5 stars! Are the sushi rolls as good as Kanno or Sake Don? Well, no, probably not, but I am giving this restaurant five stars for a few reasons. The concept, the convenience, and the price. It's conveniently located right by clearview mall, so it's in a perfect location for a lunch or dinner before the movies or before a shopping trip. It's kind of like a sushi version of Pei Wei. You order up front and the food is brought to your table. The prices are great especially for the amount of food you get. The lunch bento box really caught my attention because you get a choice for each component. I chose the hot and sour soup, fried rice, spring rolls, crunchy roll, and chicken teriyaki. My boyfriend chose the salad and the cream puffs for his so that we could share and try everything. I really liked the cream puffs, but I liked the sauce that the spring rolls came with. I love that I was able to get a crunchy roll rather than a california roll which is what most bento boxes come with. The chicken was good, and it was quite a filling/enjoyable meal for $10.00.",1,"good"
"3","I had a sudden crave for Sushi last night and passed by this brand new restaurant last night, my wife and daughter wanted to give them a try, and glad we did.

My daughter ordered a California roll from kids menu, and it came out with a very cute 2 components bento box which had cali roll and fries, my daughter chose an organic milk with her meal and total was only $6. 

My wife and I ordered a bento box, hot and sour soup was delivered to our table right after we sat down. Soup was very tasteful, chicken teriyaki in the box was perfectly cooked, it was tender and there was a baby bok-choy vegetable underneath the meat and it was yummy with the sauce. There were two pieces of vege spring rolls came with the box, extremely fresh, vegetables inside was crunchy and had lots of flavors. The portion of the bento box was so big that my wife ahd to ask me to share with her. 

I ordered couple of special rolls because I noticed the price is fairly cheap like only $11, for most of sushi restaurants probably will charge $13-$14. Pop this roll is a cooked roll, I also ordered Ocean waves which has raw tuna and salmon on top. I got my rolls less than 10 minutes with the bento box, we were kinda surprised by how fast they make sushi. The presentation of the roll was great, rice melted in my mouth and they were full of flavors with the sauces, the raw fish was extremely fresh, I have to say they are definitely one of the best sushi i ever had. 

We couldn't finish the food we ordered cause the portion was too big, my wife packed the rest to take them home. Overall,  it's a cool place with very relaxing atmosphere, price is cheap but doesn't compromise the quality. Food comes out really quick which is perfect for people who want good sushi but hate to wait. I absolutely recommend this new restaurant and definitely will go back soon!",2,"good"
"4","SushiPop took over the old Romano's Italian Street Food building. Everything is exactly the same inside which always had a nice clean feel for a counter service restaurant. 
The food was exactly what I thought it would be as soon as I heard it was a chain. Its basically  grocery store sushi at restaurant prices. 
We ordered the jalapeno popper($11), create your own($12), seaweed salad($4), cream cheese puffs($4.5), kids chicken tenders($6), kids corn dog($6) and fried oreos(3 to an order for $3) for dessert.
The jalapeno roll was very small in relation to the cost and it being on their specialty menu. I created my own roll which includes 6 items(seafood/veg) total so it was bigger but lacked flavor. The sauces for the roll and cream puffs tasted like they came out of a commercial size container. The seaweed salad has shredded iceberg in it, I guess to stretch it but how much does seaweed really cost them? The kids enjoyed the chicken over the corn dog. Most likely because the hot dog had a tempura batter. 
This place may be good for beginner sushi eaters on a short lunch break. We were on a short lunch break but the quality left us unsatisfied.",1,"bad"
"5","Sushipop is apparently a chain started in Florida.  It is open 7 days/week.  This place is so new (near Clearview on the river/Kenner corner) you can't even find it with a Google search, and it was only the big ""NOW OPEN"" sign driving past that made us notice it was there. Parking is behind the restaurant and accessible from Quincy St. which runs parallel to Veterans between Clearview and Transcontinental. The website URL on the take out menu links to a website that says ""coming soon"". Maybe that's the result of being part of a chain, but if it were me I'd be sure my website and menu was up on opening day.

DECOR
Inside is an attractive, very modern decor with a spare, open, clean Japanese feel. There are several Japanese sculptures over the serving area. It feels like Chipotle.

SERVING STYLE:
It is a cafeteria style restaurant where you walk up to the counter, order and pay, they give you a number and bring the food to your table. You purchase the drink ($2.25) they give you a cup to fill with your choice from the fountain.  They have utensils, napkins, nozoki (the little dish for soy sauce/wasabi) ponzu & sriracha sauce by the drink bar.

The tables and some benches are fixed to the floor, there are several elevated long bar type tables but also some with moveable chairs. The chairs are hard and your butt is uncomfortable by the time you finish eating (e.g. eat and GO).

FOOD: 
Overall they have a moderate variety of offerings. The prices are higher than sit down/service Japanese restaurants, the portions are small, and the food was almost flavorless. None of us were full when we left.

We all had the Bento Box which has five components and you select one from each of the five sections: 1) miso, hot/sour, salad  2) fried veggie spring roll, cream cheese dumpling, fried dumplings  3) 3 types of rice (1/2 cup)   4) 4 small california or crunchy roll pieces   5) Chicken or beef teriyaki or shrimp or veggie tempura (2 meat/2 veggie for total of 4 pieces) with tempura dipping sauce.  Everything was OK, it was just flavorless.  Those who had the salad said the miso dressing was good, those who had the cream cheese dumplings said they were good, I had the hot/sour soup which was neither hot nor sour and had the slimey thickness of too much cornstarch thickener; it basically had no flavor.  The spring rolls were greasy and had an unusual taste like from pickled cabbage or something. It wasn't very flavorful and was served with a sweet sauce.   The tempura, I had 2 shrimp, one small onion ring and a inch and a half diameter piece of sweet potato, was undercooked and had gooey batter beneath the outside crisp coating.  The shrimp inside were overcooked and slightly chewy. The california or crunchy rolls wer small and served with half a thimble full of (green) wasabi and a few slices of ginger.

I ordered one of the sushi wraps to take home for dinner. The spicy salmon wasn't spicy and the ""field greens"" were a piece of lettuce, there were matchsticks of cucumber and a slice of avocado and some white rice.  The wrap was about two fingers in diameter and maybe six inches long, and open at both ends. It was wrapped in soy paper. It simply had no flavor. They encourage you to add a side salad for $1 so it totals $10.50.  That is way overpriced for what is basically a fresh spring roll wrapped in soy paper instead of rice paper. 

I doubt I'll go back. There are too many other sushi restaurants with much better sushi and other foods, more flavor, wider variety and less money.",2,"bad"
