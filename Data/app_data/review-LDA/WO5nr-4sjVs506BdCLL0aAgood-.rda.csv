"2","KUCHI Sushi & Hibachi is a fairly new combination restaurant that serves fresh sushi and sashimi on one side of the restaurant, and sit-down Japanese Hibachi-style cooking on the other side of the restaurant. Normally these types of hybrid restaurants do a good job in one area, but fail in the other, however KUCHI has found the successful formula to blend fresh and innovative sushi rolls with the artistic showmanship and delicious cooking on the hibachi grills.

You'll find KUCHI in the AMC 24 Veterans movie theater shopping center along Anderson Road. There are several other restaurants, coffee shops, and bars on the various outparcels around the movie theater. Unfortunately many of the previous restaurants have gone out of business after a short while, leaving me to wonder if this shopping center is haunted by the ghosts of restaurants past?

KUCHI has been open about three months as of this writing, and the exterior still looks a lot like the former Bennigan's restaurant that occupied the same space. Through the front doors and you'll be greeted by the hostess who asks if you want to have sushi or hibachi-style dining. If you say ""hibachi"" then you'll be led to the left to the traditional U-shaped tables around the hibachi grill. If you say ""sushi"" you'll be directed straight ahead to either sit around the large sushi bar, or at one of the nearby tables. I have no idea what they will do if you say ""both"".

On the sushi side of the restaurant, they also have a small sake-tasting bar in the back of the room. Presumably this is where you would sit and wait for the rest of your party to arrive before being shown to your hibachi table.

On this particular night I decided to sit at the sushi bar and try some of their rolls, although on my next visit I'd like to try the teppanyaki menu choices. The bulk of the menu is filled with creative sushi rolls and sushi special combinations, KUCHI offers traditional nigiri and sashimi, but the focus seems to be on their rolls. If raw fish isn't your thing then the flip side of the menu has teriyaki, tempura, katsu and noodle dishes, in addition to the plethora of protein choices that can be grilled up on the hibachi by your chef. They have some limited vegetarian options, but this is primary steak, chicken, and seafood on the grill.

For my dinner I ordered the Spicy Maki combo which were three rolls - spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy yellowtail. Very basic, and very good. Upon the recommendation of my server I also ordered the Painted Lady roll which was a spectacular combination of spicy lobster with mango and asparagus, topped with spicy tuna, and avocado, and served with mango sauce and Sriracha. That roll was delicious!

The emphasis is on the chef's knife skills and artistic presentations of each plate of sushi. I watched them carving little statues made with daikon radish and carrot which were true works of art. It would be fun to go back with a group and watch them prepare larger platters and sushi boats with these playful creations.

I do hope that KUCHI beats the odds and stays open for a while. I'd like to go back and try some more of their sushi, and possibly get a group together to go for their hibachi-style meals.",1,"good"
"3","Fantastic meal at Kuchi!! As big hibachi fans, we were all sad when our favorite local restaurant closed recently, and have been looking for a new spot. We decided to try Kuchi on a whim, as it is right next to our favorite movie theatre. Let me just say, we were BLOWN AWAY!

The service was fantastic. The server was very attentive and friendly, the manager and owner each visited our take making sure everything was living up to our expectations, and even the bus boy was incredibly courteous. The chef was probably the best Hibachi chef we've ever had. Funny, friendly, and despite a little bit of a language barrier (he told us he came over from Korea within the last month), he worked very hard to make sure we were happy. An offhand observation that they used real garlic instead of garlic butter led to extra garlic on everything for us (after asking to make sure it was okay, of course). We all got saki squirted into our mouths, every trick you've seen and a few you haven't was performed, and we could not stop laughing the entire time.

The food was fantastic. Nothing was anything less than you've had anywhere else, and the steak in particular (our party had both the filet and standard sirloin) stood out from any other hibachi restaurant. The meal was finished with a nice bowl of ice cream, completely unexpected. 

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the effort that went into decorating. The restaurant is clean, modern, distinctly Japanese but not overdone to the point of being kitschy. The best word we came up with to describe it was sleek. Clearly, every detail of the restaurant and your meal was thought out, and it's clear management really cares about your experience. I can't recommend Kuchi highly enough, and we're thrilled to have found a new favorite hibachi restaurant!!",2,"good"
