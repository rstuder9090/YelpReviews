"2","Where else can you get unlimited sushi & Hibachi at a legit asian restaurant that is not a typical rundown buffet that might kill you due to grease and food poisoning?????? Nit Koizi!!! Oh and yeah.... of you're a Floridian/tampa bay resident...... DEF APPRECIATE!!!!! The fact we are the lucky ones to have this type of establishment in the Bay Area bc theres no other place or restaurant that offers this type of service and the selections of food across the state of country! Here's what i mean.... if you ever decided to go for a endless meal aka buffet style but not having to standup and pick your food then this is the place to GO. Yes, your traditional would be the cheap/nasty taste of rundown china buffet table with the same exact crap you would fine at a buffet style restaurant. Not with Koizi!! Not only do you have the luxury to order off the menu for your food but they cook it from the back and bring it to you. Now, the tradeoff is.. if you don't finish your order... they will charge you unless if its not a protein item. Oh btw, if you want to get fancy and step up the quality of their food... you can get a teppanyaki/hibachi grill table too! And no reservations needed unless you're celebrating with a large group. Comprendai?!?! Your typical hibachi grill has a set menu to pay and its pretty expensive plus no option to get certain food endless(Sushi/meal.. well with Koizi.. the same exact menu where you can get endless food (sushi & meat) endlessly!!! Yrs and they freakin grill it with your rice/veggie... which btw everything taste better on the hibachi grill. Not its a onetime grill from the hibachi grill.. but thats all you need for your meat. And yess.. even the traditional apps and entree of chinese foods are unlimited. Not from a buffet table you typically walk to get from. So yeah, tampa, clearwater, NPR... appreciate and love the ideal of having this unique kind of restaurant where you can get better quality food that is endless and able to get hibachi table grill too with the endless meal menu. Don't hate! Just own it fool!!!! Cuz no hibachi restaurant will offer or come close to what koizi offer...unless you like the cheap/trashy style buffet. Oh yeah, sushi is great! But the steak & shrimp on the tableside grill...... wowwww weeee Yummy!! Its the best taste wuality shrimp you'll ever find for a low cost endless meal. Under $20 dinner price baaaaay baaaay!!",1,"good"
"3","This has got to be the best Hibachi Restaurant my husband and I have ever experienced!  I made reservations for Our 5 year Wedding Anniversary.  I wanted something exciting and special.  Thats exactly what we got!  We were greated by the friendliest staff and an Amazing Hibachi Chef.  He entertained us with his culinary skills and the food was amazing.  Not salty or dried out, not even spicy.  We both got the Endless Hibachi Buffett for a very good price.  It included 2 choices of meats or seafood, soup or salad, a drink and even an appetizer.  Comes with fried rice, veggies and noodles. I also ordered a Sushi roll called the ""Yummy Yummy"" and it sure was.  I have never tasted Sushi so fresh it melted in your mouth.  The seaweed was fresh, crab was very chilled and cucumber nice and firm, along witg a creamy sauce and rolled in sticky rice with sesame seeds.  My husband was able to have a 2nd helping.  I couldn't.  I guarantee you will live it there and be so full after.  Great job guys, bucks very well spent here and we will definatly be back and with more people!",2,"good"
