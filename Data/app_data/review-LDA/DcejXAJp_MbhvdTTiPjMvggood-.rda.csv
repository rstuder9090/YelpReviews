"2","One of my favorite spots for to go Hibachi was O.E.C. In St Pete. Since moving to Seminole, I don't go as often as I'm not in that neck of the woods as much. So I was thrilled to find out that they opened up a new location here in the Seminole/Largo area! As far as the food quality, it is just as good, if not better than the food in the St Petersburg location. Meat is fresh, veggies are cooked well and the rice is abundant. The yummy sauce is still fantastic and the miso salad dressing is still my favorite dressing ever! I've had hibachi here several times already and it's been consistently good. The sushi is still slightly above average, but not the best by any means. The lunch special remains a good deal (two rolls and a soup or salad for $7.99) but I'm a bit disappointed they don't have the dinner deal for $10 like the other location. Not sure why. Either way, there are not many places around you can pick up an order of hibachi without having to have the ""dining experience"" of sitting around the hibachi grill. Those restaurants are fine for entertainment, but sometimes you just wasn't the food sans the show. Check em out!",1,"good"
"3","A modest mom and pop shop that serves extraordinary food. Their sushi, sashimi, and rolls are fresh and generously portioned. There are quite a variety of rolls that would suit anyone's needs.
In addition, there are Japanese and Chinese dishes available as well as Asian Fusion dishes like their noodle soups, tempura, and stir fry dishes.
They have an impressive selection of appetizers made either cooked or fried or raw. They have an equally impressive selection of soups and salads made to order.
I'm also impressed with the selection of beers and wines including a variety flavored sake and plum wine .
The kids get a kick out of the imported soda pop drinks and their unique dessert selection.",2,"good"
