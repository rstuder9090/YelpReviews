"2","I worked in Glenside a few years ago and ordered some Chinese from them, before I got into sushi, and was always impressed with their food. Recently I've been able to dive more into the sushi scene and have had a hard time finding good local places. Queen is pretty close to home for me and with a big banner boasting ""$20 ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI TUESDAYS"" I had to give it a shot.

The first time I went was with my friend Adam and we got a lovely variety, I absolutely enjoyed my Volcano roll and Spider roll as well as some of Adam's Hamachi roll. For $20, their all you can eat sushi is a great deal considering how much some of the special rolls can cost. And for a sushi novice like myself, its a great chance to open up and try some more things you're not quite familiar with. This past Tuesday I met up for dinner with another friend of mine who's much more well versed in sushi and he said it was just alright, but I still think it was delicious.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the service could stand some improvement, though each time I was there I've never had a problem, they've been very attentive when my drink was getting low and if the plates were becoming empty. They're still absolutely worth checking out!",1,"good"

Food: More times than none, I come for the lunch special. During the week, between 11-3, you can get a Chinese lunch special for less than 6$. Included in the lunch special: 1 main entree, white rice or pork fried rice, soup or an egg roll or a soda. Their sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken are my favorites. Another great special at QS is their All-You-Can-Eat sushi option on Tuesdays. This includes any sushi roll from the menu made to order.

Service: The employees are very nice and fast. If you ordered pick-up they are quickly getting you in and out with a smile. If you want to sit down they are welcoming and attentive. Ive never had a bad experience with any of the staff at QS.

Location: Inside is very authentic with traditional Chinese decor. The atmosphere is very warm and comforting and suites the needs of a quick lunch or a proper dinner. As any location in Keswick Village, parking isn't the best. Especially if there is a show at the Keswick Theatre.
