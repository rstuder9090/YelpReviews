I've been back to Crazy Sushi probably a dozen or so times in the past 12+ months and have had a fantastic experience each and every time.

The staff is always so friendly, welcoming, accommodating, and provide all-around excellent service.  

I've tried many of their specialty rolls, and obviously have favorites among them - but I enjoy them all and find their creativity a huge plus. Seaweed salad is delicious, too!

I've taken a number of visiting friends to Crazy Sushi and everyone has always had a fantastic meal and enjoyed their overall experience.

Nothing but positive words for Crazy Sushi!


---ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/28/2012---

Crazy Sushi isn't groundbreaking or the best reasonably priced sushi around, but I had an overall very enjoyable experience and will be returning shortly.

I went on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was practically empty, which was nice, and allowed my party to enjoy our bottle of wine that we brought (BYO = huge plus.) 

I ordered a green salad (average), miso soup (could've been much warmer), and two sushi rolls: an Eel Avocado Roll and the Spicy Tuna roll. Both rolls were delicious and everyone at our table received their rolls presented in a different and exciting arrangement. Our rolls came out quickly and tasted fresh.

The service was very nice. The wait staff checked in frequently to make sure we were doing ok (probably because the restaurant was so empty, but it was still appreciated.) Also, the current promotion was another plus: if you spend more than $30, you receive $5 off, and if you spend more than $50, you receive $10 off your bill. 

Next time I go, I might be more adventurous and try a special roll or something different, but I was content with my meal and the overall experience.",1,"good"
"3","If you're looking for affordable, yet quality sushi, one of my favorite spots to recommend would have to be Crazy Sushi in the Rittenhouse area. An added bonus? It's BYO! 

It's a slim, sleek space with comfortable seating and a sushi bar at the end. 

Salad
 
Salad was fairly standard with fresh Romaine. The ginger dressing was clearly freshly made. 

Vampire Bowl [$9]
Spicy tuna tartare, avocado bowl
  
A must order in my mind is the Vampire Bowl, their unique take on tuna tartare. I loved the contrast in textures with the crunch from the tempura and the creaminess of the avocado bowl. The sweet wasabi mayo was balanced by the light heat from the spicy tuna. 

Vegetable Tempura [$5]

The GF's a sucker for veggie tempura and this didn't disappoint. A thin layer of tempura coated mushrooms, sweet potato, and carrots. It came accompanied with a light tempura dipping sauce. 

Beef Negimaki [$6]
Scallion, thin-sliced beef, teriyaki
  
On this trip, the negimaki was a bit disappointing. The beef could have been more thinly sliced and better seasoned, though I appreciated the bite of the scallion amidst the teriyaki glaze. 

Triple Sushi [$25]
Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tuna roll

The triple sushi featured some of our favorite nigiri rolls, including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. All very clean-tasting and fresh, the platter also came with a tuna roll. I appreciated that the tuna was whole and not minced within the sushi. 

Uni Sushi [$8]

I was also in the mood for uni so asked for an order of uni sushi. Then again, when am I *not* in the mood for uni? Sourced from California, these were creamy, light, and buttery. 

Bloomingdale Roll [$13]
Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail, spicy shrimp, avocado, longan
  
I was also intrigued by their Bloomingdale specialty roll. The pink seaweed seemed a bit more delicate in texture and taste, supporting the sweetness of the lychee. This contrasted with the subtly spicy mixture of tuna, salmon, crab yellowtail, and shrimp (whoa!). Due to the laundry list of items, the flavors were a bit muddled, but definitely veers toward the sweeter side of a sushi roll. Interesting! 

Sweet Potato Roll [$5]

Of course, we also had to try our standard sweet potato roll. Crazy Sushi has one of the best iterations, with a wonderful juxtaposition of creaminess from the sweet potato and a light crunch on the exterior. The black sesame seeds studding the surrounding rice made for a perfect bite. 

So if you're not looking to go omakase and want a relaxed sushi meal, I'd recommend checking out Crazy Sushi. Whether you're looking for Americanized rolls or nigiri done right, they've got you covered.",2,"good"
