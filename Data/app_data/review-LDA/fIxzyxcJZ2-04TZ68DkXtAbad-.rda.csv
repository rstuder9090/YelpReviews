"2","I've been to Sushi House a few times and it has turned me into a sushi lover.  The first time I ordered a bento box which gave me a nice selection of everything: soup, salad, chicken teriyaki, rice, dumplings, and a roll.  On subsequent visits I decided to expand my palate and try the all-you-can-eat option.  I tried a variety of rolls and find something new I like every time I go.  The food tastes great and I find it better than another local AYCE sushi establishment.  It's a little pricier, but worth the money.  Kani salad and red bean ice cream are really good.  I highly recommend the crazy roll!

The only issues I've had with this place is that service can be slow at times, depending on how busy the restaurant is. I've seen people get disgusted and walk out.  Also, I'm not sure they've always included everything we've ordered when we've put in a large order.  

The decor of the restaurant is modern.  It can get noisy when busy, as it's a great place to go with a larger party.  Overall, the food is great if you're willing to overlook the few downsides.",1,"good"
"3","I read a lot of reviews about this place before going and it had a lot of bad and average reviews. I had low expectations going in about the service and food because of those reviews. Experiencing the place first hand, I think it is comparable to the other sit down order buffet places and a little better in some aspects. Let me say that the service and waitresses were not what the other reviews said. They do lack speaking English but they understand most of the things that are said. There were plenty of people while I was there but the waitress came over to constantly check on us. The kitchen menu is big and they offer things that others places do not like the kinia salad. I had to order the Yaki tori becaus I read from another review that the chicken was well done and rubbery. I thought it was moist and very tasty. 

The sushi is very good. Presentation is solid and the amount of rice they put on is not overbearing. If you order a lot and not finish, that is your fault. The sashimi pieces were huge! Usually when I go to a ayce place, the sashimi pieces are tiny but this place, they cut it very generously. 

If they are actually reading these comments, I gotta say kudos to them cause they've improved from what was written before. Another note is that they are a recent business. They're working out the kinks so to give them a bad review this early without any constructive feedback is unfair. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Will be going back if I want another ayce adventure.",2,"good"
"4","Came in for the all-you-can-eat sushi on a Sunday night @7:45. On Sunday the closing time is 10:00 and last call for sushi is 9:30.

Atmosphere - I really liked the inside of this location as it was modern and set a nice mood. Albeit it could be a bit dark at times, that is okay with me.

Food - The sushi definitely tasted good and would recommend to someone. 

Service - The overall service was were I had an issue. The waitresses were very nice and attentive. The sushi was made promptly and brought out in a timely manner. My issue with the service was two-fold.
    1) Although the sushi tasted good, my orders were wrong each time. I was never brought any white-tuna (my favorite) sushi or sashimi after the first plate and other items were either missing or different. Also, after a couple of plates the sushi chefs would give very small portions of sashimi, which were less than half the size of the first plate. This was extremely disappointing. Yes, I simply upped the # when ordering, but then combined with the first issue it became a problem.

    2) Around 9:15 I noticed that the sushi chefs were cleaning up and so I quickly asked for another menu to get my last round. I was told to hurry up and do it quickly as they were almost done cleaning up. I ordered my last round (not complete again) and rushed to eat it as the servers were starting to mop up. I was very frustrated that they were just going to close the sushi bar without letting anyone know (earlier the server clearly stated to us that the last call was 9:30). Also, one of the servers had a child who came over to us at the end of the night and kept pestering us for the entire rest of our meal (I am okay with a little bit but it was about 20-30 mins). 

Overall, I would not go back as I like to go later towards closing so I imagine this would always be an issue. It made me feel very rushed which I did not like. I have had better experiences elsewhere.
That being said, if you are ordering takeout or going to dine-in and not eat  a-lot of sushi then I actually would recommend this place as the food and atmosphere were good. 

Recommendation - I tried the Kani Salad (only app I got) and it was soooo good.",1,"bad"
"5","Giving one star but I would give negative stars if I could. Went here with my sister for a second try because the first time we tried it was through a pick up order which they screwed up completely. Wish I hadn't given a second try. Got here and was impressed with how cool the inside was. They did a great job with the interior except for the fact it's June and they still had snowflake decals up on the window- first sign that they don't care about their business. It's a byo so my sister and I brought a bottle of wine and they didn't accommodate us at all I.e. No ice bucket to put the wine in until I asked twice. Finally the waitress (I guess (had multiple random girls through out the dinner taking ""care"" of us)) came back with an ice bucket with one cup of ice in it and practically threw the bucket on our table and walked away. 
Cutting to the chase we each did the all you can eat sushi and I checked the amount of sushi we wanted by putting tally marks by each sushi piece. The waitress brought out all my sisters and didn't bring any of mine out so I waited twenty minutes thinking maybe it took longer but finally asked and she said the reason they didn't make it was bc they thought the tally marks were crossed out. Bc I had put 4 tallies with a cross through it to make 5. They thought the cross through it meant I didn't want the sushi. Ok whatever but right above the 5 tallies I had two tallies written down for a different sushi. So they never put my order in. Why wouldn't they just ask me? And I don't believe that no one has ever put tallies as a way to mark how many pieces of sushi they want. Our waitress paid no attention to us bc she was too busy eating at the sushi bar. We got the bill and noticed we didn't get oranges like the other people who got their bills received.  We watched her take oranges to another table and still never received them after we were sitting there finishing our drinks. So they don't treat their customers equally. Anyway the service sucked the sushi was mediocre and I'll never be back. This place is awful and I don't think it will be around much longer.",2,"bad"
