"2","I'm not sure whether to review CDB's or Sake House, so I'll review both. With only one entrance, we chose to sit on the Sake House side and order both pizza & sushi. We asked to sit in a booth, and were easily accommodated as the restaurant wasn't busy on this Friday night. Our server was quick to greet us & take our drink order.

First, drinks are 2 for 1, all the time! I ordered sangria, and our sever asked if I wanted half a shot of brandy in it, for no extra charge. Yes, please! Howard had whiskey with a Pepsi chaser. My two sangrias totalled $6, and Howard's two whiskey shots were $5.50 - what a deal, and they were a good size! 

Initially, we only ordered two California Rolls, because Howard was impatient to order. After we looked at the menu, we decided to get the $12.99 dinner special any 2 rolls among 40 options, plus a miso soup & house salad. Our young server was not flustered one bit by this change, although the kitchen was and one of the California rolls came out much later. The house salad was good, with lots of very fresh lettuce. Our server told us the ginger dressing was made in-house, and while it was good, I didn't really like the flavor. The miso soup, however, was fabulous! Not too salty, yet quite flavorful.

The three of us shared a Spider Roll & two California Rolls, and we all agreed they were excellent. The rolls were large & plumply filled. In fact, my daughter, a sushi enthusiast, said the quality & flavor was better than most other sushi restaurants she frequents. 

I was not impressed with the cheese pizza we ordered. While I'm not a tomato sauce fan, this pizza had nearly no sauce at all. It tasted like a giant round cheesy bread. I certainly expected better from CDB's. Plenty of cheese, and it WAS good, but this wasn't really a pizza.

We enjoyed our evening at CDB's/Sake House, and we'll definitely return for the sushi & drinks... And maybe we'll try another pizza.",1,"good"
"3","Sake House is my favorite place to get sushi because it is so darn inexpensive. The lunch special (2 rolls, miso soup, and ginger salad) is about $8, which is so cheap! The dinner deal is only $4 more, starting after 3:30pm. There is a bit of a hit in quality, like with service time, but overall, it is very fun to come here. The atmosphere is very enjoyable in my opinion (just a little loud sometimes with CDB right next door).
My favorite roll is the sweet potato roll. I love the cream cheese inside paired with the fried sweet potato. It all will melt in your mouth! I am not a huge fan of the veggie roll, but you can asked for it tempura style, and it tastes amazing. They easily have taken special requests when I ask for things like tempura style or add cream cheese on rolls.
Back when I ate fish, my favorite roll was the 2011 roll. The combination of the salmon and cream cheese tempura style is out of this world! You should definitely try this roll when you come here.
I enjoy the convenience of this restaurant (right next to USF) as well as the hours and the prices of sushi here. As well, I've always found it easy to place an order online for food. They have a pick-up option, so all you have to do is fill out the order form online, wait about 20-30 minutes, and drop by to pay and pick up your food. It's super convenient for someone craving sushi with a busy schedule not wanting to wait in the restaurant for too long.
I know I saw some other people say they prefer other sushi places, and I have tried a few others myself, but I have always liked the sushi I've had at Sake House best, and will continue to come here as a first choice.",2,"good"
"4","Awefull!!!! 
If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. 
Don't waste your time or money!!!
Stay away! Any other place is better than here!",1,"bad"
"5","I'm never ordering from this place again. They missed up my delivery order and give me something totally different. This morning I was having a sushi craving and I ordered some food from them via postmate. Because I'm on a diet , I ordered vegetable roll , chicken gyoza and California roll so I dont feel too much guilt about breaking my low calorie diet. I waited for almost an hour and was so hungry. When the food was delivered to me i felt so excited but instead I receive a box of fried, saucy, cheese stuffed roll . It was pretty much like eatin fried cream cheese because there's barely anything else in that. Normally I would probably just shut up and eat it , like all the other times. But I really dont want to eat that giangatic fried saucy cheese roll. So I called the restaurant , I was polite and just trying to ask for a solution.  But instead I just wasted 10 minutes of my time listening to this lady in heavy accent repeating how it is not her fault.  I mean, you can explain for yourself but you dont have to repeat the same thing over and over. I try to speak but she wont let me and she just raise her voice louder and keep going on talking as if this is some kind of stupid competition.  I just want a solution that's all , I'm not here for the blaming game.  Now im hungry, semi depressed and stuck with a high calorie fatty cheese roll that would destroy my week of hard work. And have no choice because im hungry.",2,"bad"
