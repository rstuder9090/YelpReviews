"2","Kelp sushi joint is located off bay to bay in South Tampa in a plaza next to Starbucks. Kelp Sushi Joint is located in a tiny restaurant. Unlike most other sushi bars where the bar seating faces the raw seafood display case, you get a side angle view of the sushi chefs preparing sushi as well as the chefs preparing other dishes in the back. 

Kelp sushi joint has some great $3 appetizers deals including the crab rangoon, edamame, ginger salad gyoza, miso soup, and seaweed salad.  In addition, Kelp sushi joint also has a great all day $12.95 special for any 2 classic sushi rolls and 1 starter! 

For the appetizer we ended up getting the crab rangoon and it was quite flavorful and not too dry as many tend to be 10/10. For the main course, we ended up getting the  Rose Cave Deluxe Sushi Roll which consists of  Tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, scallions, eel sauce, spicy mayo 9/10, the Florida Sushi Roll which consists of Tuna, salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and the Mexican which consists of Shrimp tempura, avocado 9/10. 

Kelp also offers Sushi burritos and bowls, which come made to order with your choice of 2 proteins, 4 vegetables, and 2 sauces including spicy mayo, jalapeno mayo, cilantro citrus aioli, teriyaki sauce, and eel sauce. Bowl options include salmon teriyaki, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, tofu teriyaki, chicken donburi, beef donburi, salmon Poke, himachi Poke, Tuna Poke, sashimi, and nigiri. Kelp does not have a liquor license and only serves beer and sake, no mixed drinks. 

I look forward to coming back to try more appetizers, a poke bowl, more sushi rolls, or a burrito roll!",1,"good"

This was our second attempt at Kelp.  First attempt was slightly after 9PM on a Friday or Saturday to find they closed at 9.  Seriously, a restaurant that closes at 9 on a weekend is weak.  I know this is Florida, but not everyone is into the early bird special.  And this play is trying to be hip, kind of new-wave sushi, yet they close basically at sunset?  Weird.

Second time around was better.  First thing you notice about Kelp is how small it is.  I think there are 6-10 tables, and the place gets busy.  There were one or two tables when we arrived, but it filled up.  They also did a tremendous amount of to-go orders.  Point being, if you want a table, it might be a crap shoot.  

We ordered 3 rolls and my girlfriend got crab rangoons.  Can't tell you about the rangoons, but the rolls were very good.  Like I said, a lot of them are far from your tradition sushi rolls - even in the specialty roll concept, they were a bit far out.  For example, we got the Desert Oasis roll, which has mango and a thai chili sauce.  Sounds strange, right?  I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was actually my favorite.  We also got a Underwater Lake roll, which has boiled shrimp, cucumber, avocado and krab salad - also very good, but again, not very traditional.  Finally, we got a Salt Cove roll, which was spicy shrimp, smoked salmon with jalapeno.  This one I didn't care for, and I've had sushi with jalapeno before and really liked it, but in my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well together here.

So really, I'm deducting a bit for that last roll, but the others were very good.  And to Kelp's credit, they go light on the rice, heavy on the fish.  Drawbacks to Kelp, besides the size, are the options and prices.  They don't have a very extensive menu - 23 rolls (I think) and some appetizers.  Seems like a lot, but that's maybe 1/2 a sushi menu at other places.  Additionally, they are mostly specialty rolls.  They do not have too many of your regular run-of-the-mill rolls.  Finally, price wise, most of the rolls are over $10.  So if you're looking for your regular $6-$8 sushi rolls, this isn't for you.  But if you want to try something different, and really enjoy it, I think you should give Kelp a try",2,"good"
