"2","This restaurant is definitely trying to capture a wide audience, making sushi, hibachi (even at weekday lunchtime!), and also Chinese menu items.

Gordon Ramsay would be skeptical of such a large and varied menu, and we have, quite honestly, made only a couple of cursory visits to this restaurant, trying to figure out if the reviews and ravings are valid...

Our first visit was a date night, on a Saturday evening, and the Hibachi room was packed with large groups, and birthday parties.  With all the Hibachi activity, there was a lot of steamy oil in the air, and we were not very enticed to have the sushi that we originally walked in the door to consume.  So we sat in the ""non Hibachi area,"" where it was at least a bit quieter, and we had some hot sake (this was during this past winter).  I have a nose for cheap oil, and this wasn't as harsh as you might find at the cheap Chinese buffets... It was O-K.

The second visit, during a lunchtime, we were on an Udon kick, and since we saw they offer Udon Nabe soup, we ventured back during a lunchtime.  Not nearly as busy, not nearly the oily vapors in the air, and the Udon had a lot of nice, fresh veggies.  That's a score!

With our third visit, feeling desperate to find even palatable Chinese food in the MJ area, we gave it a try, along with a lunchtime chicken teriyaki bento box.  Fresh and nicely prepared!  (Though the spring roll was quite lacking... just shredded cabbage.  It was bland.)

Over-all, the place is clean, the service is decent, the food quality is good, and the selections of food items, earn four stars (for the area... if this place was picked up and set down in downtown Seattle, well, all these stars would fall away.)

We still need to wade-in, with a bit of caution, on the sushi, so the stars may get adjusted, in the event that the sushi is either outstanding, or a bomb...",1,"good"
"3","The miso soup was mediocre. It didn't have that delicious broth taste, but it was nice and hot. I could also tell that the tofu, seawed, and onions were fresh. Now the avocado salad was BOMB. Fresh avocado and the ginger dressing was delicious. The soft shell crab was also good, not too greasy and full of flavor. Philadelphia roll has great flavor. Usually these folks kinda have a flat taste, but the cream cheese was nice and creamy. The fire roll was slightly disappointing only because I'm didn't think it was that hot. For something called the fire roll I expected my mouth to be burning but I didn't feel any spice whatsoever. But the flavor was quite good. I loved the tempura! The batter was on point, it held up on every vegetable and was not greasy at all. So as far as service goes, it wasn't the greatest nor the worst. The waiter seemed very indifferent and didn't check on me at all. Overall I had a good experience and will come back again.",2,"good"
