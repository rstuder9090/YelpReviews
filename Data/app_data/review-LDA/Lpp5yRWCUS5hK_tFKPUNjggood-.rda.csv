"2","We were having a little retirement dinner for my father with a party of 13. They were more than accommodating giving us a spacious section and allowing us to set up some small decorations and a cake as well. Our waitress was wonderful. Super engaging with us, attentive, and always making sure we were more than taken care of.

This restaurant does not have the most ideal location. It is off the interstate but can't be seen from there. It is off highway 50 as well. Again, not easily seen. Tucked away behind the Steak n Shake, a couple of restaurants tried their fare at this spot, but have since passed. You is taking their shot, and I'm glad they are.

Now, most importantly, the food. We ordered the sushi boat to share amongst everyone. This consisted of 21 pieces of nigiri (shrimp, bluefin tuna, salmon, eel, escolar, red snapper, and hamachi). Rolls consisted of California, Spicy Tuna, and Rainbow. Fantastic variety for all tastes.
I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to sushi. There's a couple of places in St. Louis I strictly go to for sushi based on freshness and variety. Rarely will I dabble with anything on this side of the river. Super glad I tried their sushi here because it is legit.
There is no doubt that the fish is fresh. There's no off taste or smell and the overall taste is super clean. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of sushi they have here. They don't have a ton of options for nigiri, but that's actually a good thing in this case. With slightly more limited options, they can have great quality control when it comes to their fish. Even the rice was great. Some places will just serve up nigiri on some packed rice. Here, I could tell there was a hint of vinegar in the rice and some (not all) had a tiny bit of wasabi inbetween the fish and rice. Which is by design. Certain types of fish are accentuated wIth the presence of that slight hint of wasabi. It's those tiny details which really make You stick out when it comes to their sushi.

There's more than just sushi here though. I didn't get a chance to try, but half of our party ordered Korean entrees (bulgolgi, bibimbap, and galbi). All thought their food was tasty. As a Korean, I'll take that and I hope to try their Korean entrees soon.
AND they have Japanese cuisine as well. Udon, katsu, tempura, you name it. Tried some of the tempura items they have and they were super tasty. Crispy, lightly fried, and not greasy at all. Even got some complementary teriyaki shrimp for our party and that was great!

If you're craving sushi, Korean, or Japanese fare, You has got YOU covered. I highly recommend this restaurant. They have what you need if you're craving any of these kinds of foods. But, the menu is not excessive. It's a perfect mix of variety and quantity. You literally will not find any place else in this area that has this kind of diversity with these particular cuisines. 

I can't wait to come back here and try some more of what they have to offer and I suggest you do the same!",1,"good"
"3","I've eaten here three times since they've opened.  The first time we ate Korean. The second time was sushi.  And the third was a combination of both Korean and Japanese.

On the first trip, I had the gori gom ton (oxtail soup).  It's kind of hard to come by unless you can pick it up at Andrea's or, if you're lucky, one of the Korean restaurants across the River.  It was spot on.  The meat had cooked long enough that it only needed a gentle persuasion to pull it off the bone.  The banchan  was varied and never ending.  I like my kimchi on the fresh side (pretty typical for American taste buds, most Koreans prefer it a little more aged - read that as ""sour"") and it came a little more on the aged side, but it was still well done.  All in all a nice visit.

On the next visit, we had sushi - three rolls and sashimi.  Without boring anyone too much with a long winded experience, the only thing I will say is that it was probably the freshest and best executed I've ever had on the Illinois side of the river.  And I've been to them all.

Our most recent trip was a follow up based on the past two experiences and  just to see how consistent they were.  If I'm going to be even slightly critical, the vegetable tempura was just a bit oily.  Other than that, it was another stellar visit.

Wait staff was extremely kind and attentive on all trips.  The owner even came out to talk to us.  Very nice and even offered some fresh grilled fish for us to try.

This is my ""go to"" place for Korean and sushi.  The Korean food isn't overly seasoned as other places.  It's just done right.  The sushi has been as fresh as you can get with some different take on the rolls found most eLsewhere that are heavily cream cheese laden.  And they've been beautiful to boot.  The thing that I don't get is that it's had relatively light traffic the three times we've been there, but maybe it was because it was always for lunch on Saturdays.  This place begs to be discovered  by those son the East Side wanting something fresh and different.",2,"good"
