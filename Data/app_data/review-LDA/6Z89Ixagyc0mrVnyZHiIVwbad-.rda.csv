"2","I had the pleasure of sampling the menu at a Tampa area restaurant that was new to me: Catch Twenty-Three! Located in Westchase, Catch Twenty-Three serves food in a casual, upscale atmosphere...with a hint of Caribbean/Latin fusion. I was very excited to see what the menu had to offer!

I met up with my friend Megan to experience Wine Lover's Wednesday: Catch Twenty-Three offers an ""all-you-care-to-drink"" option for wine. For $15, ladies can select from four featured wines (Barone Fini Pinot Grigio, Kunde Cabernet, Wente Chardonnay, and Hobnob Pinot Noir...but selections might change over time). Gentlemen are also able to participate in Wine Lover's Wednesday for $20.

Let's get started with the food, shall we? Megan and I started with the Red Stripe Beer Calamari - it is marinated for 24 hours in Red Stripe Jamaican beer and served with a roasted red pepper remoulade. The calamari came out golden brown and perfectly crunchy, without being greasy - yum!

Next was a bowl filled with braised blue cheese mussels, with Applewood smoked bacon, lemon juice, white wine, and blue cheese crumbles. It was definitely a beautiful dish, and since I don't eat mussels, Megan reported to me that she enjoyed them! I did like the addition of bacon; everything is better with bacon, right???

Next up was my personal favorite of the appetizers for the evening: the shredded pork and sweet plantains. This combination was absolutely delicious, and I wanted to fight Megan off so I could eat the entire plate by myself. Darn you, sharing! The dish featured fried plantains, slow roasted shredded pork, and guava barbeque sauce. The combination of sweet and savory was perfection, and it made me want to whip up a batch of pulled pork at home in my slow cooker soon...

I think everyone should be proud of me for the next dish: we were served the Crunchy Tuna Roll. Now, I am very new to sushi - I typically only select options that feature cooked fish or have no fish at all. This was the first time I actually consumed raw tuna. And I actually liked it in the sushi roll - can someone please give me a gold star? The Crunchy Tuna Roll contained spicy tuna and avocado, and was topped with crunchy tempura on the outside. Add a slice of ginger and some soy sauce, and it was a perfect bite.

The main courses were up next. Megan and I sampled three different options: the Chilean Sea Bass with mango salsa, the Guava Salmon wrapped in Applewood smoked bacon, and the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Scallops. Chilean Sea Bass is always a favorite of mine (but I hardly ever order it), so being able to enjoy the buttery, smooth texture of the fish was a treat! The scallop was crusted to a perfect golden brown as well!

On to dessert! I wasn't sure if I had the space in my stomach, but I did manage once we were presented with two slices of pie. The Key Lime Pie was served with fresh whipped cream and lime zest. Now, I am particular with key lime pie (honestly, the best key lime pie I've ever had is STILL from J.J. Gandy's), but this slice actually impressed me. It wasn't overly tart, and the filling was nice and smooth. It would be a refreshing (and classically Floridian) way to end a meal! However, my heart always goes pitter patter for anything involving chocolate, and the other pie was a slice of Catch Twenty-Three's Chocolate Mousse Pie. It was thick, it was rich, it was decadent: I was in heaven.

All in all, we had a wonderful experience dining at Catch Twenty-Three, and I'm looking forward to returning on another evening!

"3","My expectation for finding a decent dinning spot at Westchase area was pleasantly fulfilled after visited Catch 23 on two occasions; one is for drink and another for dinner. 

The trendy interior design and layout portraits a spiffy image for the restaurant. Bar area is partially separated from the dinning section and extends to the outdoor patio, which helps to brew a hint of flirting atmosphere for the stylish younger crowds of Westchase. The shaded dinning section provides an intimate atmosphere that suitable for dating or business dinner. Seats are arranged with wide space and comfortable to sit through a longer dinner. 

Catch 23 is specialized for preparing seafood dishes. For our visit last night, 3 of us ordered the seafood, and one ordered chicken. We all agreed at the end that the seafood dishes were definitely worth ordering again. I had the sauteed grouper with tomato and cream sauce ($25). The fish fillet was surprisingly moisturized and tender; though the cream sauce was light, yet its delicate flavor mysteriously eliminate the odd fishy taste of the grouper. Lightly sauteed yellow squash as a side dish was a good touch. Hubby ordered seafood trio ($ 26), it come with sealed tuna steak, pan fired sea bass steak and grouper steak. None of these fish fillets was overcooked. The final winner was the grouper because its flavor and texture. My friend ordered Paella ($ 19), It was a large deep soup plate full of abundant seafood with a light tomato-based broth on top of coconut rice. He licked the bowl. 

The services we received from both visit were formal and professional. I believe the staffs are well trained to perpetuate an impression for guest who seeks upscale dinning experience, however, greet guests with a welcome smile and deliberately ignore guests when they are leaving is somehow a conflicted behavior. An Isolate incident I sincerely hope so.",2,"good"
"4","Let me start by saying that I had been wanting to try Catch Twenty Three since my wife and I moved to Tampa. After nearly a year here we finally buckled down and went. My parents were in town so they came along. 

After sitting down we were greeted by our waiter, who was timely and polite for the most part, and we ordered our drinks, which came out fairly quickly. My mother, who ordered a pomegranate margarita, got nothing more than a glass of colored lime juice. No real flavor to the drink at all and incredibly sour.  We also ordered the Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer. Again, it came out fairly quickly. The oysters weren't bad, not great, but not bad. They were properly cleaned and seasoned well. 

For our entr√©es my wife ordered the Steak Diane, my mother the Filet Mignon,  my father the Catch Salad with Shrimp and Mussels, and I ordered the Mixed Grill. Let me just say that the food was mediocre at best. My wife loved the sauce over her steak but the steak itself was under seasoned. They did a great job, however, cooking the meats to our preferred doneness.  My mother had no complaints about the Filet Mignon but didn't really have any praise for it either. My father, on the other hand, didn't care for his pasta dish. Said it was incredibly bland. The shrimp were rubbery and chewy from being severely overcooked. The mussels were just cold and tasteless. Finally, the Mixed Grill I had ordered started off promising. It comes with chicken, steak, and pork. The steak was seasoned and cooked very well. The chicken was primarily seasoned with aromatic seasoning, so not a lot of, ""in your face"", flavor. The chicken was also cooked perfectly. It has the right tenderness to it and it was very juicy. The pork is where it starts to get scary. The meat was horribly undercooked to the point it was almost raw in the center.  Needless to say I didn't eat much of that. From what I did taste in my first bite, though, the pork had been seasoned slightly and covered in sauce. This place seems to use their sauces to hide the fact that their food isn't worth the hefty prices they charge. 

My father has been sick for the last three days after our dinner here. He's been vomiting and has had moderate diarrhea. My wife had diarrhea the rest of the night after dinner but felt fine the next day. Luckily, my mother and I were spared from any would-be illnesses that could've come from Catch Twenty Three.

Overall, the food, that of it that wasn't under or over cooked, was mediocre at best. The drinks were poorly put together and tasted awful. The staff was polite and timely with our food, but at what cost? I won't be going back to Catch Twenty Three. I give this a 1 out of 5 rating. Their only saving grace was the fact that they cooked most of the meats to our specified doneness and the fact that we're still alive. Sick as hell, some of us, but alive.",1,"bad"
"5","The hubby and I came here last Friday night and had one of the oddest dining experiences ever. Period.
First let me begin by saying that I live in a big metropolitan city. I don't think that this has highered (or lowered) my expectations, but I could be wrong.

So, we made reservations on opentable.com for 7:00. I thought that this restaurant was in Tampa, but unfortunately it's waaay up somewhere north of TPA. I made sure to call and let the hostess know that I would be 10 minutes late. No problem she said, thanks for calling to let us know. From my 30 second convo w/ the hostess, I thought this would be an awesome experience.

We walk in the door and there is no hostess to be found, so we stand in the small entry waiting...and waiting...and chaos all around...waiting.

It takes the hostess several minutes to find my reservation, and asks us to sit in a small booth. When we ask if we can have a larger booth since my husband is 6'5"", she says that the larger booth was for someone with a reservation (uhhh???..ok)

One thing I can say about this place is that the lighting is fantastic. It isn't too bright, and isn't too dark. Just right.

After about 5 minutes our server comes over and tells us that she is going to be taking care of us and that she is training so and so (nowhere to be seen). My thoughts are really? You're training someone on a busy Friday night? GREAT! We get 2 servers for the price of one! 

We give the server our drink orders and she can't understand the name of the wine I ordered which was a very simple french wine. I'm sorry, but if you have no idea how to pronouce the wines you're selling, that is a problem. I literally had to point to it on the page.

I'll make the rest short and sweet:

-It took several minutes to have our order taken. At least 15 after drinks,
- When I asked the 2nd server if their restaurant had any sustainable fish, she had no idea what I was talking about. She came back about 20 minutes later, and just said ""no, sorry""...uhh...no, what? No to the question I asked you 20 minutes ago?
- server 1 and server 2 had NO communication what-so-ever. Orders were taken, and retaken, questions were asked and reasked. It was simply annoying
-we were served bread and hard butter
-the bread and hard butter had no plates
- we were also not given any plates for out appetizers
- when my appetizer came some guy just put it on the table and left without explaining to me what the FOUR sauces on my plate were, so I didn't even bother to try them.
- The Coconut shrimp were incredibly tough as well as the shrimp in the paella
- When our cesear salads came out with no dressing at all, the waitress didn't even apologize, she just said ""Oh"", then asked if we wanted it spun, or just on top...uh...the proper way, please....duh...
- The mahi dish was so bland, I had to ask for  sauce on the side
- the paella was inedibly salty
-when we asked for it to go after not even having 2 bites (we were taking it home to doctor it up and possibly turn it into something edible) we were presented with 2 plastic containers on our table without even being asked why we didn't eat any of our food. I'm sirry, but I just dropped close to $100 and you're going to make me put my food into the container at this tiny table? Ridiculous.
- The food ended up in the garbage when we got home. It was simply irrepairable.
I have no intention on coming here again, and for the prices, I feel that the service should have been better. 
Our server was unkempt and seemed like she would be better suited for Applebees or Chilis, not a casual fine dining restaurant.",2,"bad"
