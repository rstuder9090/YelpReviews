"2","This restaurant is definitely trying to capture a wide audience, making sushi, hibachi (even at weekday lunchtime!), and also Chinese menu items.

Gordon Ramsay would be skeptical of such a large and varied menu, and we have, quite honestly, made only a couple of cursory visits to this restaurant, trying to figure out if the reviews and ravings are valid...

Our first visit was a date night, on a Saturday evening, and the Hibachi room was packed with large groups, and birthday parties.  With all the Hibachi activity, there was a lot of steamy oil in the air, and we were not very enticed to have the sushi that we originally walked in the door to consume.  So we sat in the ""non Hibachi area,"" where it was at least a bit quieter, and we had some hot sake (this was during this past winter).  I have a nose for cheap oil, and this wasn't as harsh as you might find at the cheap Chinese buffets... It was O-K.

The second visit, during a lunchtime, we were on an Udon kick, and since we saw they offer Udon Nabe soup, we ventured back during a lunchtime.  Not nearly as busy, not nearly the oily vapors in the air, and the Udon had a lot of nice, fresh veggies.  That's a score!

With our third visit, feeling desperate to find even palatable Chinese food in the MJ area, we gave it a try, along with a lunchtime chicken teriyaki bento box.  Fresh and nicely prepared!  (Though the spring roll was quite lacking... just shredded cabbage.  It was bland.)

Over-all, the place is clean, the service is decent, the food quality is good, and the selections of food items, earn four stars (for the area... if this place was picked up and set down in downtown Seattle, well, all these stars would fall away.)

We still need to wade-in, with a bit of caution, on the sushi, so the stars may get adjusted, in the event that the sushi is either outstanding, or a bomb...",1,"good"
"3","The miso soup was mediocre. It didn't have that delicious broth taste, but it was nice and hot. I could also tell that the tofu, seawed, and onions were fresh. Now the avocado salad was BOMB. Fresh avocado and the ginger dressing was delicious. The soft shell crab was also good, not too greasy and full of flavor. Philadelphia roll has great flavor. Usually these folks kinda have a flat taste, but the cream cheese was nice and creamy. The fire roll was slightly disappointing only because I'm didn't think it was that hot. For something called the fire roll I expected my mouth to be burning but I didn't feel any spice whatsoever. But the flavor was quite good. I loved the tempura! The batter was on point, it held up on every vegetable and was not greasy at all. So as far as service goes, it wasn't the greatest nor the worst. The waiter seemed very indifferent and didn't check on me at all. Overall I had a good experience and will come back again.",2,"good"
"4","Run away. Far far away. This is not ""fresh"" Japanese food. This is dry, fried, mayo-y, watery, fishy, Japanese food. 

For people that have had high grade sushi or even regular grade sushi, you will be sorely disappointed with the quality and flavor of their sushi and other menu items. 

Miso soup was similar to cloudy water. No salt whatsoever. 

Ginger dressing tasted like Burger King zesty sauce minus the horseradish.

The first bite of sushi tasted like FISHY fish. Not fresh. Not what you want in sushi. 

The bomb lobster roll stuffing portion was 90% fried pieces and 10% lobster so it felt like just dumping the fryer into your mouth. And then topping it with mayo. Which is the predominant ingredient of the chefs ""special"" sauce.

And then the salmon! Ugh. First off, I guess kudos to them for the large portion. One piece is equal to two in any other restaurant. But I tried to bite through the salmon and literally couldn't. So unbelievably stringy. I had to shove the rest of it in my mouth. Tuna and salmon are supposed to have a nice rich flavor with a  buttery texture and I got nothing of the sort. 

Even the fortune cookie was so stale it started to taste like the wrapper.

I guess I just love sushi and therefore have high expectations. Maybe shame on me for expecting otherwise from Mount Juliet. 

Regardless of location though, the best part of my meal should not be plain steamed rice and coke.",1,"bad"
"5","I hate leaving bad reviews, however this one is absolutely necessary to leave. I went in to have dinner with my son and we sat at the hibachi table. 

Another family came and joined us, we placed our orders, and when the chef came out and read the orders back to us I told him I was allergic to shrimp and needed my food cooked before the shrimp. 

The family that came in after us was super nice about it and said they could wait to have their food cooked separately due to my allergies. 

Everything was going good until he cooked the shrimp first. He didn't clean the grill before putting the rest of the food, mine included, on there and proceeded to use the same utensils he had just used for the shrimp. 

I was only able to eat the rice before the rest of the food touched my plate. My son however has a nice lunch for later. 

My advice is if you have allergies use extreme caution when sitting at the hibachi tables. 

I would have asked for the food I couldn't eat to be taken off, however someone had already paid for our meal without us knowing.",2,"bad"
