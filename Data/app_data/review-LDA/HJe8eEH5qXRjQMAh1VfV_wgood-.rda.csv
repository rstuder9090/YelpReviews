"2","This place is fairly new to the 66th Street area.  Perfect location and I guess much needed since Arigato's went out of business. The building is huge and very very nicely decorated.  Whomever designed this layout did a good job.  There are many tables for hibatchi and a separate bar area for those who just want to order some appetizers and a drinks.  The happy hour specials are sweet. They have a few rolls that are $5, appetizers for $6, select beer and house wine for $5 and  a few other items.  I arrived at 4:30 on a Saturday with family.  FYI. They don't open till that time, but not sure if that's just a weekend thing or their hours in general.  The happy hour says it starts at 5 but it actually starts when it opens at 4:30, at least on Saturday. 
Of course like any hibachi place you are seated with other customers at one table. The chef we had was named Fluffy. He had a great personality, funny, witty, and just good customer service. He made us laugh and entertained us the whole time. My family had the Kobe beef, shrimp and chicken combo which comes wiry rice, veggies and pasta. Basically, a whole lot of food so Of course they needed boxes. I personally had sushi from the happy hour specials which was good. Simple classic rolls that filled my belly to satisfaction. I also had the spring rolls and edamame. 
I would come back again during happy hour for a snack and some drinks. If you are in the area, bring some friends and stop by!",1,"good"
"3","Went here on a Thursday night with a reservation at 7:30 P.M. for a party of 7. We didn't receive a table until 8:10 P.M. This goes against their claim that ""you should expect a short wait timy when arriving for a reservation with your full party due to the nature of our restaurant"".  Atmosphere is open and clean.

I will say this was the only negative aspect of our meal. After seating we got a spider roll as an appetizer, which was very good!!! 

Props to our server Alex, absolutely fantastic, caring, friendly, and helpful! He told us all about the menu and what he recommends. If you could request a server at any restaurant, I would choose him.

I split a steak and shrimp hibachi with my girlfriend and it was stupendous. Portions of shrimp were a little small but the shrimp, fried rice, sirloin, soup, ginger salad, veggies, and noodles were all great. No complaints about the food whatsoever, great deal for good food. Definitely recommend the yum-yum sauce over any others. I also tried a friends chicken and filet mignon, which were also good. 

Our chef was funny and made commentary the whole time, making sure we interacted and had a good time. Typical hibachi experience nonetheless

Not a warning but there is an automatic 18% gratuity at the time of writing due to covid circumstances which is completely reasonable.",2,"good"
