"2","This rating is heartfelt with one caveat: if you want to experience the wonder that is Chef, be prepared to pay. Some of his newer creations are priced as high as $20-$22 per maki. Still, even on my modest budget, as infrequently as I am able to go there, after my first visit Temaki became almost exclusively my place for sushi. 

Chef Aki is, in the true sense of that word, an artist. To immerse yourself fully in his art, sit at the bar and give yourself up to his improvisation: forget the menu and let him make what he will. Let him create. I have never encountered a sushi chef so bold in his use of sweets and sours -- fruits, berries, sauces... Yet he never loses grasp of the delicate balance among tastes and textures. Just the right fish with just the right leaf. His rolls unfold in your mouth in layer upon layer of flavors -- in triumphant discoveries or in gentle surprise, in bursts of fireworks or in a tender brush of a velvet paw. For an adventure, don't ask Chef what's coming next.

If you prefer to know what you're eating, though, take a look at the menu, and you'll see what I mean. On my first visit, before I knew to give up control to the Master, I ordered two special rolls and never thought of sushi as I had before. Each piece of the Deluxe Roll is like a dawn ascent to a mountain top, starting in slow twilight, then waking you up unexpectedly with deep breaths of all-permeating fresh air, and suddenly culminating with a shock of sunrise -- most stunning, reigning above all things human and not, having changed every color and line -- and you stop chewing and sit for a moment just wrapping your mind around this profoundly new experience of light hidden in taste.
And then, Tuna Tuna brings you back down. It is a calm hug of a roll, with a bit of crunchy potatoes over soft, slightly warm tuna, spiced just right for the utmost comfort. I am from Russia, and yet this Japanese tuna roll tasted to me like home itself. It was like a warm hearth at the heart of a log cabin, evening setting beyond the windows into the still-glowing snow. It was an embrace of a quilt, safety of familiar things. I closed my eyes when I ate it, and I didn't want to open them.

I've never seen Temaki very crowded, but Chef is the only chef, and they do take-out and delivery, too, so the service may not always be fast. If I wait, I sip tea or sake and watch him work. There is little better entertainment than watching a master at work.",1,"good"
"3","Temaki Sushi replaces an older sushi restaurant I just knew as ""Sushi"" because of the ""Sushi"" sign in the window.  It could have been called ""open"" or ""closed"" for all I know.  My wife, son and I go out for sushi at least once a week in the Philadelphia suburbs that emulates what you would find at Blue Fin in Plymouth Meeting or Tomoe Sushi in NYC.  

The quality of the food was very good and there are some interesting items on the menu like their seaweed salad which combines several different types and colors of seaweed.   The old standby, Spicy Tuna handroll, was fresh and tasted great.

They need to work out some ambiance kinks.  Our appetizer (seaweed salad and edamame) came out quickly which was great, but the rolls we ordered came out right behind them - a little too quickly.  No one likes to be rushed.
The music needs to be something from satellite radio and a little more suited to the ambiance.  I was turned off by the non-commercial free rock station playing a little too loudly.

And when you're presenting the check, it needs to be in a Visa or Amex folio.  A receipt placed on the table quickly soaked up the splattered soy sauce.  I nice orange, or piece of fruit, for good luck usually accompanies the check in Chinese and Japanese style restaurants.  It's a nice little thank you for spending almost $80.00 on a Tuesday night.

We'll definitely be back!",2,"good"
