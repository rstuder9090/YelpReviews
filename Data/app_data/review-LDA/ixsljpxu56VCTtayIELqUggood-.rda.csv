"2","Well, it's 6 years later and Tokyo Sushi is still here and seems to be larger than I remember it.  I picked up a 3 roll combo from the pre-made case at $12 which have 4 pieces each of tuna (fine), salmon (fine) and Yellowtail (surprisingly very good) with scallions - all in brown rice and rather large pieces.

I am pleased and Shall return now that I am back in this area again.

Seems more like a ""real"" sushi place now and less like ""supermarket"" sushi.

Next time I will order some nigiri to order.

My only complaint?  $7 - $9.5 for a sinlge handroll (They call theirs a demaki vs. temaki)???
Way too high.  

All in all very pleased and will return - and soon!",1,"good"
"3","This is my favorite in Delaware.  The menu is simple and perfectly executed.  Rolls are reasonably priced, artfully made and are PACKED with fish!  I do believe they use flash-frozen sashimi grade fish, but the color, texture, taste and smell are perfect.  Easily the best spicy tuna I have ever had.  I think the secret is the kewpie mayo along w/ the right amount of sriracha and sichimi powder.  Frankly, I can't get enough of this place and have at times, eaten it every day for lunch for weeks.  I've gone as far as to pick it up for dinner AFTER having had it for lunch. Their introduction of short-grain brown sushi rice has been great!

The Sushiman, YC Park is amazing to watch.  I've seen him skin a cucumber with a sword-like sushi knife in no time flat, in a single ribbon and then continue to shave it into a nori thin sheet for his tuna naruto roll roll.  The temaki are as big as a carnival iced cream cone.  You can barely finish one of them, there is so much fish in there.  The nigiri are beautiful.  Uniform pieces of fresh fish, perfectly perched on the best sushi rice I've ever had (just the right amount of vinegar and sugar).

Skip the newly opened Kooma.  Save Mikimotos for a night out, but go to Tokyo for lunch!  The owners are lovely, so support them in this tough economy.  If you must eat sushi, eat it here!

Why not 5 stars?  I have to save it for places that serve the local fresh fish, plucked out of the water that morning.  Let me know if you find a place that does!",2,"good"
