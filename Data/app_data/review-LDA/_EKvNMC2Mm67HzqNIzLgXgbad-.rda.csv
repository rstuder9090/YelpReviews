"2","This rating is heartfelt with one caveat: if you want to experience the wonder that is Chef, be prepared to pay. Some of his newer creations are priced as high as $20-$22 per maki. Still, even on my modest budget, as infrequently as I am able to go there, after my first visit Temaki became almost exclusively my place for sushi. 

Chef Aki is, in the true sense of that word, an artist. To immerse yourself fully in his art, sit at the bar and give yourself up to his improvisation: forget the menu and let him make what he will. Let him create. I have never encountered a sushi chef so bold in his use of sweets and sours -- fruits, berries, sauces... Yet he never loses grasp of the delicate balance among tastes and textures. Just the right fish with just the right leaf. His rolls unfold in your mouth in layer upon layer of flavors -- in triumphant discoveries or in gentle surprise, in bursts of fireworks or in a tender brush of a velvet paw. For an adventure, don't ask Chef what's coming next.

If you prefer to know what you're eating, though, take a look at the menu, and you'll see what I mean. On my first visit, before I knew to give up control to the Master, I ordered two special rolls and never thought of sushi as I had before. Each piece of the Deluxe Roll is like a dawn ascent to a mountain top, starting in slow twilight, then waking you up unexpectedly with deep breaths of all-permeating fresh air, and suddenly culminating with a shock of sunrise -- most stunning, reigning above all things human and not, having changed every color and line -- and you stop chewing and sit for a moment just wrapping your mind around this profoundly new experience of light hidden in taste.
And then, Tuna Tuna brings you back down. It is a calm hug of a roll, with a bit of crunchy potatoes over soft, slightly warm tuna, spiced just right for the utmost comfort. I am from Russia, and yet this Japanese tuna roll tasted to me like home itself. It was like a warm hearth at the heart of a log cabin, evening setting beyond the windows into the still-glowing snow. It was an embrace of a quilt, safety of familiar things. I closed my eyes when I ate it, and I didn't want to open them.

I've never seen Temaki very crowded, but Chef is the only chef, and they do take-out and delivery, too, so the service may not always be fast. If I wait, I sip tea or sake and watch him work. There is little better entertainment than watching a master at work.",1,"good"
"3","Temaki Sushi replaces an older sushi restaurant I just knew as ""Sushi"" because of the ""Sushi"" sign in the window.  It could have been called ""open"" or ""closed"" for all I know.  My wife, son and I go out for sushi at least once a week in the Philadelphia suburbs that emulates what you would find at Blue Fin in Plymouth Meeting or Tomoe Sushi in NYC.  

The quality of the food was very good and there are some interesting items on the menu like their seaweed salad which combines several different types and colors of seaweed.   The old standby, Spicy Tuna handroll, was fresh and tasted great.

They need to work out some ambiance kinks.  Our appetizer (seaweed salad and edamame) came out quickly which was great, but the rolls we ordered came out right behind them - a little too quickly.  No one likes to be rushed.
The music needs to be something from satellite radio and a little more suited to the ambiance.  I was turned off by the non-commercial free rock station playing a little too loudly.

And when you're presenting the check, it needs to be in a Visa or Amex folio.  A receipt placed on the table quickly soaked up the splattered soy sauce.  I nice orange, or piece of fruit, for good luck usually accompanies the check in Chinese and Japanese style restaurants.  It's a nice little thank you for spending almost $80.00 on a Tuesday night.

We'll definitely be back!",2,"good"
"4","What a shame. Utterly disappointing. 

Came for dinner and sat outside. Table and chair were wobbly but staff were nice.

Food 1/5: I ordered tonkatsu ramen and the sushi combo A. The tonkatsu ramen is the farthest thing from tonkatsu ramen I've ever had. They don't have pork broth, so I chose miso broth. Nothing about the ramen was salty enough. The pork tonkatsu wasn't tonkatsu but it was barbecued? It tasted like if you combined thin cut pork with a 4th of July barbecue and burned it a bit. It was also very tough and chewy, unlike real tonkatsu which should be fatty and melt in your mouth. But ok, this is a sushi place and not a ramen place, right? Let's talk about the sushi.
With the combo A, you get a salad and miso soup. The miso soup was bland, not salty enough, and had a funny aftertaste. The salad was just sad. A few pieces of lettuce and some dressing. And the sushi was awful. It was bland and soggy and chewy. The seaweed was somehow soggy and maybe stale? The overall roll just tasted like nothing but depression. Such a shame when you ruin such beautiful fish as tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. I was hoping that maybe sushi could be this place's redeeming quality, as it is a ""sushi restaurant,"" but nope. The sushi was even worse than the strange, strange ramen.

Service 1/5: As for the service, the staff were nice but as I was sitting outside, like with every other restaurant, I was completely neglected. The waitress was friendly and helpful at the beginning, but never checked on me after I got my sushi and didn't even bring soy sauce with the sushi. Really? I left 90% of the food on my plate, and she never asked how it was or offered to remake/comp. 

So I paid $35 for wasting 2 hours of my day and eating a few bites of depression. What a let down.

tl;dr: bad food, bad service, don't recommend.",1,"bad"
"5","Absolutely worst dining experience of my life.  Sushi is great but not worth the wait and bad service we received last night.    I have been here a dozen times and we understand that you have to wait for fresh sushi ad I understand that it gets crowded for Wednesday night Dining Under the Stars but come on.....to wait 1 hour and 10 mins for edamame to come out and then another 1/2 hour for 4 sushi rolls to come out and then another 10 minutes for my daughters dinner to arrive is ridiculous.  
We sat down at 7:15 and waiting 10 mins before someone came over to give us our red solo cups of water (come on manager/owner) you know it is busy on Wednesday night - please invest in cheap plastic wine and water glasses.  We asked if any wine glasses were available...10 mins later he comes back after we flag him down with more red solo cups....said someone took the available wine glasses (yup - that was the table next to us that just sat down).  He took our order at that time and that was the last we saw of him until we flag him down to ask for more water and ice.  Came back with water but ice machine is still making ice so he'd be back in a few minutes with that.  We waited but he never came back - we asked another server who happened near our table and he grabbed us ice in a few seconds.  After an hour and watching the other servers bring out their customers food, we asked about our edamame....it came out 10 mins. later with a salad or my daughters meal.  My daughter asked for a fork for the salad.  Never got one.  She ate the salad with her hands....crazy.  My daughter and I order 4 rolls of sushi and my other daughter order shrimp teriyaki....at 8:40 we actually decided to leave to go somewhere to eat.  We walked in to our waiter who was on the phone taking to go orders and told him we left $15 on table but we weren't waiting any longer.  He came out as we were walking away to say that sushi was up if we still wanted it.  We stayed because we were starving.  My daughter asked where her shrimp teriyaki was and got a blank stare back with a I will bring it as soon as it is up.  We were done our sushi when her dinner arrived.  When he delivered her dinner we said we would like the check please.   Nope - we had to track him down on the phone to get our check and pay our bill.  
Not sure if this was the waiters fault (the other servers were getting food out immediately and very attentive) or more management as this waiter was being pulled in different directions if doing all phone orders AND trying to wait on tables.  
This was always my go to sushi place in Media but NEVER again until the owner gets it together.  There is so much potential here but if you can't keep good servers or invest in your restaurant, you will lose good customers.",2,"bad"
