"2","(3.5, rounded up)On a busy Friday night at 6pm, here's my dinner experience of 2. 

-The Good: 
1)Quick polite service: Though busy, we felt we were taken care of. 
2)Crab Rangoon was crispy and filling. Hibachi Chicken. Portion sizes were excellent. The Yum-Yum sauce is really good, with a minor spicy twist. Sushi was good and menu is expansive.  ($4.50 for 6 pieces)!
3) Atmosphere: It was clean and mostly quiet. There was a bustle about the place, but overall it was an enjoyable evening. 

The Meh:
1) The Miso Soup was average at best (not much flavor, overly salty). 
2) The fried rice was okay. Again, not much flavor. 

-The Bad:
1) My wife ordered the filet mignon ""medium"" but it came back very rare. We asked our waitress to take it back and cook it longer because we ordered ""medium"". The second time it came back, it was also rare again. We asked for a plate of chicken instead and didn't touch the steak. So be aware of the steak doneness!! We were scared of the chicken doneness as well after this. It really detracted from our experience. 

Summary: Almost everything we had was good, but not excellent, in a surprisingly pleasant atmosphere. Being brand new, this place has potential to be excellent.",1,"good"
"3","So I ended up here by accident. Yelp or my map app was having quite the off night because after a business meeting in the general area of this restaurant I clicked ""get directions"" to about 4 places from yelp only to ""arrive"" -- and find the restaurant nowhere in sight. So I decided to eat at the very next non fast-food place I saw and this is where I ended up.
And...it was pretty, pretty good. I was famished after a long day and opted for a sushi appetizer--the crazy roll--and a vegetable pad Thai plate.
The sushi was excellent: great flavor and texture, delicious sauce and while it's not usually the kind of thing I pay much attention to it was plated excellently, just really pretty to even look at.
I devoured that with a (decently priced) beer and waited on the pad thai. Which was not bad though not as great as the sushi. I've never had pad thai that wasn't at least somewhat spicy but this one had no heat and the noodles were just a tad on the mushy side. Other than that the flavor was really good and the portion was generous particularly for the price.
All in all a good find and I'm glad I ended up here. I was here on a weeknight and it was an enormous place that was very sparsely attended so hopefully other folks discover this place soon.",2,"good"
"4","Went in having high hopes because of the reviews plus the place is gorgeous. Ordered takoyaki and gyoza for apps. The gyoza were alright but the takoyaki was extremely chewy since the octopus was overcooked. For the meals we got teriyaki steak lunch hibachi with mushroom soup and ginger salad and katsu chicken bento box. The soup and salad tasted like all the hibachi places I've had which is good. The steak was underseasoned and overcooked, the rice was decent but it's hard to mess that up. The yum yum sauce was ok, I've had way better. The veggies were all raw, which I don't mind if they are supposed to be. My meal came out kind of lukewarm like it waited awhile to come out. My friend's katsu was unimpressive and the sauce tasted bottled. The sushi was alright in the bento but they didn't even bring out chopsticks for it. Plus no sauce for the gyoza in the bento even though the app comes with it. The whole experience was lackluster and the waitress was somewhat rude and not very attentive. Will not return at all.",1,"bad"
"5","Very disappointing experience tonight. 10/10 will not be back. Service was absolutely awful, as we had the pleasure of what seemed like a server who was on his first day on the job, and maybe first day in a restaurant.
After ordering drinks, and food, he brings the soup course to the table and delivered it with his thumb in the bowl. Of course I ask for another one, and he seems dumbfounded that I'd even care.
He brings the salad course, and I ask for chopsticks, so that we could eat. He then proceeded to go help another table, then go to the computer, put in an order, and then disappear into the kitchen, all while I'm waiting for my utensils so I can eat. I finally get up, and get them myself.
Now, I'm out on a date with my wife, to celebrate the raise she just got at work, so we're trying to have a romantic meal.
Next, he brings out my plate of bbq pork katsu, with no bbq sauce, and not my wife's sushi.
By the time he brings her food, my pork is getting cold, and tough, and I still have no bbq sauce, which I have to ask for. 
Again, he decided to put in an order before getting me my sauce, so that by the time he brought it, the food was very cold, and very tough.
My wife ordered a rock lobster roll, which she quite enjoyed, but she had to eat alone, as I sent mine back.
It seems like on a better night, it may be a decent place, but there are a million good restaurants in town. I'll be choosing a place that puts consistent and quality service as a first priority.
I'd give 0 stars, since I left and had to go get dinner elsewhere, but the ambience was nice, and my wife did enjoy her sushi, so that deserves one star.
Sorry about only leaving a 10% tip young man, but you've gotta earn those good tips through service.",2,"bad"
