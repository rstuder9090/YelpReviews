I can't describe all my countless nights there.  I agree though, it's really not a Friday nightclub, but you can't deny how amazing the bar is on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday  (in that order).  80s night is amazing and I have been to many other spots and NOTHING comes close.  The bartenders are amazing and they get it; if you hook customers up they keep on coming back!  Even as slammed as they get, they are still very attentive and you can get a drink in reasonable time.

The set up is pretty cool, three levels and an outdoor patio so it really has a place for everyone.  First floor for the drinkers and dancers, second floor for the creepy guys staring at girls dancing and people making out, third floor for the pool sharks and chillers and outside for the drunk chain smokers.  You can't ask for a better place for all types of party-goers.

I left Santa Barbara over a year ago, and the bouncers and bartenders still remember me; really gives me the Cheers vibe :).

I've never eaten the sushi there and will never have the desire to. Girls' dirty partying shoes have been on that; how can customers eat raw fish there to? 

Bathroom is a little gross at night, but I blame that more on the drunk idiots than the bar itself.",1,"good"

A friend recommended this bar/club for my friend and I to go to when we went to SB because we wanted to experience SB's nightlife. We got there around 9:30pm, and it wasn't crowded yet...so we got a good spot at the bar and ordered a drink...the drinks are decently priced...beers around 6-7 bucks, mixed drinks about 9 bucks. The bar tender even gave my friend a free drink! Awesome!

The dancefloor didn't have people dancing on it until about 10:30pm, but from then on people were having fun! There were some guys that all they wanted to do was rub up against you...but that's to be expected. 

When my friend and I got tired of dancing, we went up to the 2nd floor where they have private lounge areas, which was sweet...it gives you time to cool down before you head back to your hotel. They have a bar on the 2nd floor too if you want more to drink.

Overall, we had a fun night...and I think everyone should stop by this bar when they're in SB.",2,"good"
