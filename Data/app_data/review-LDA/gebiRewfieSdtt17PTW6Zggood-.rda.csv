"2","Let's talk sushi! I personally love the Mexican Roll. 1/2 price sushi is ALL DAY Sun-Thurs and ""All-you-can-eat"" sushi @ the bar ONLY is ALL day Friday & Saturday. If you want Hibachi (the tables where they cook for you)  I would HIGHLY recommend calling in and making reservations ahead of time to ensure your seats; it gets pretty busy. And unfortunately they don't take Sushi bar reservations because there's only what? 26 seats? I mean if your dumb ass reserves 8 seats and you don't come in on time the restaurant looses money by holding your seats for someone who isn't there when there's people that could be sat =( So it makes sense that it's a ""first come- first serve"" policy. Anyways, the filet mignon is to die for @ the Hibachi grill and if you're looking for more bang for the buck try the Dinner Box or the Lunch Box at the sushi bar. It's orgasmic. OH, and don't forget dessert. If you've never had a tempura ice cream you need to try it! DEEP FRIED YUMMINESS. By the way, if you're 21 and up, don't forget to Sake-Bomb it. :) And if you're not into beer like me, try the plum wine. Absolutely love it.",1,"good"

Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!

I have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.

Save room for dessert because their fried green tea ice cream is without a doubt one of my favorite desserts of all time.  You get the fried tempura outside that is warm and crunchy with the refreshing green tea ice cream center... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This place is definitely worth your time, but it does get busy during dinner, especially on the weekends.  So if you have a large group, I would highly recommend calling and making a reservation.  They also have an early bird special with discounts off their hibachi, as long as you get there and order between the hours of 3:00-6:00 PM.",2,"good"
