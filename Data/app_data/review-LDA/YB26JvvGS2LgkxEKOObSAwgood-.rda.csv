"2","Unagi & Sushi is my favorite place to get sushi in Metairie area. The special rolls could be pretty pricey so I don't go there as often as I used to. This place is located right next to Rouse's on Airline near the Cox Communications building. This used to be the place of WoW Wingery.

As one of the reviewers previously mentioned, the interior in this joint looks very simple, and the place looks clean.

If you choose to dine in, they serve you with their complimentary noodle salad (clear noodles with white sauce and sesame seeds) in a small plate. This tastes good.

I haven't really tried their whole menu so far.  But when I go there I always go for their Hollywood Roll or Funky Margarita Roll.

The Hollywood Roll is a snowcrab-based roll with shrimp tempura in the middle, smelt roe, wrapped in soy paper with the right amount of their mayo-based spicy sauce. There is no sushi rice in this roll. If you like crunchy, don't forget to tell them to add their crunchy flakes with the roll. I found that the crunchy improves the overall taste of the Hollywood Roll. You can choose to have the crunchy on top or inside of the roll. Their crunchy flakes taste different than the crunchy in most sushi restaurants around. The crunchy flakes at Unagi & Sushi taste salty, not tasteless as in many restaurants.

The Funky Margarita roll is what really got me hooked to Unagi & Sushi. You can choose to have either crawfish or spicy tuna in this roll. I try to tell them to make it with crawfish but if I did not tell them it'll come with spicy tuna. I just prefer crawfish to go with this roll. The crawfish or spicy tuna is wrapped in seaweed then sushi rice.The roll is topped with guacamole sauce, crunchy, and some eel sauce. When I first read the menu, I was kind of skeptical about having guacamole in sushi. But I guess the people at Unagi & Sushi would not put it on the menu if it does not taste great. The onion in the guacamole can be pretty strong. So chew some gums if you happen to have this for lunch and need to go back to work afterwards. :)",1,"good"
"3","I've mostly stuck to one sushi place in town over the last six or seven years. Because of this, there is a feeling of wonder in striking out to brave a new restaurant and finding an excellent meal. Unagi & Sushi has been on my radar for awhile. I mean, I am in love with unagi, and it's literally in the name! I ordered a large hot sake, some eel sashimi, and the special crunchy roll. The portions were nice, the price was fair, and the first bite was oh so satisfying. Eel is one of those things that has to be cooked perfectly: the sauce has to be well-balanced in flavor and portioned correctly, the meat has to be so soft it melts in your mouth, and the consistency must be uniform without a bone to be tasted. This hit all three marks right on target. I already find myself wishing I had taken pictures of the carrot butterfly and flowers that adorned the plate. Maybe next time I'll snap a few photos.

The roll was so good I tried another, the eel special, and again was sent to unagi heaven. I got desert, green tea mochi ice cream, and it was so soft and tasty! The mochi was doughy and the ice cream was smooth, all th best consistency and outlined with whipped cream and sprinkles!

All I can say is if you like eel like I do, and want something that is made with care, please try this place out!",2,"good"
