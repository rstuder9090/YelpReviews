"2","I walked by this place for a few months and wasn't sure what it was (bubble tea? restaurant?). Then my friend told me it was sushi/japanese inspired dishes with bubble tea. 

I was intrigued and was going to head over for lunch, but it was raining so i opted for dinner instead. My group of 3 was super hungry so we ordered a variety of things to taste the menu. 

taiwanese salt baked chicken
fried calamari
eel and avocado onigiri
pork sung onigiri
TGI Fresh roll
Angry dragon roll (i think that was the name)
Tonkatsu don
braised beef soup

milk taro black tea
salt foam winter melon green tea

I enjoyed everything we ordered but that might have been because i was hungry. I typically don't order sushi rolls at all but thought since they had so many special rolls that i try to see if they execute them well. I'm more of a chirashi guy 99% of the time. Plus we were sharing so rolls were easier to be family style. 

I liked that the calamari were big and ""meaty"" compared to other places. The taiwanese chicken had the western china style flavors...reminds me of the chicken app over at Shanghai 1..not necessarily a bad thing, but not super amazing. The eel and avocado onigir was pretty good. The pork sung was a let down...i didn't know what 'pork sung' was... for some reason i pictured meat meat... For those wondering, pork sung is the Chinese meat ""wool"" (kinda like cotton). I use to eat that all the time when i was a kid so it wasn't a flavor thing, it was more of a let down because its not really a Japanese ingredient. Its pretty salty (naturally) so it might be good old school app for those interested. 

The two rolls came with soy wrap which is a good change (its flavorless in my opinion so those that don't like seaweed would like it). As always, these special rolls are kinda drowned by American style sauces... They weren't bad, but i'd probably try their chirashi next time to see if they have good fish in general. The rolls i can't really taste the fish. Had good texture though. 

The Tonkasu had the same breading as the calamari (i could be wrong, but tasted very similar). It wasn't anything special. I felt they are frying in a heavier oil or something (calamari and tonkatsu). I tasted my friends braised beef soup. It wasn't a traditional chinese/taiwan flavor profile...the noodles were chewing which i liked, but my friend didn't. I thought the dish was good. 

The salt foam winter melon green tea was pretty bomb. That was the main reason i wanted to come here. There aren't many if any places in philly that serve salt foam (correct me if i'm wrong).I seen it on youtube a few times and really wanted to try it. My friends said their tar tea was ""watered"" down, but i think they got it confused...They thought they were getting a taro tea but it was BLACK TEA with taro flavor. They didn't enjoy it because i think they had a different perception of what they were ordering. I tried it and it was good. They did complain it wasn't cold since it wasn't served with ice. 

Note: My friends said the rice in the onigiri and sushi had way too much rice wine vinegar--so much so that it tasted sour. I honestly didn't taste any at all. I dont' think they use ""real"" sushi rice as the grains are bit off color and size/shape. It isn't a deal breaker to me since i rarely eat rice but others might find fault. One friend said the place is 2 stars, the other 3.5 stars. My overall experience was elevated by the winter melon tea and the great service, so it is a solid 4 stars for me. Food might be 3.5. I would dock a bit more for being cash only. But prices for food were a tad lower than comparable places so you do save on that.",1,"good"
"3","Our go-to sushi restaurant had been Bleu Sushi, but we were intrigued by the rotating light sign of the cute bubble fish out front that shines on the sidewalk.  Fast forward 2 weeks, and finally we got to try their sushi and bubble tea on a late Sunday night!

I was expecting it to be very busy, but we were able to be seated right away.  There is a variety of seating, with tables in the front by the window, to smaller booths, and a lounge area with a big red couch in the middle by the sushi bar and drink station.  We were seated in the very back with round booths, which were very cozy.  I like how it's not too crowded with tables and I felt like it was a deliberate choice to preserve the ambience, with lovely lighting with clear bulbs around the lamps and the dark, cozy feel.  

We ordered:

1. Tuna avocado roll ($5, 8 pieces) - amazing, no fishy taste at all, and the ratio of fish to rice with so high!  Tender and flavorful.  The ratio of fish to avocado was also perfect.

2. Yellowtail roll with jalepeno ($5, 6 pieces) - this was also amazing, with a buttery yellowtail taste that was also not fishy at all.  The jalepeno added a tiny bit of kick and was not overpowering at all.  

3. Bubblefish roll ($10.95, 8 or 10 pieces) - THE BEST THING WE ORDERED.  Spicy crab roll with mango, wrapped with seared salmon and miso glaze.  I could have eaten two of these rolls.  Perfect balance of flavors, tons of crab filling and my favorite part was the seared salmon part on top.  The miso glaze was slightly sweet and added a great finishing touch.  Fresh mango that wasn't too sour provided texture and balance.

4. Taiwanese beef noodle soup - this took awhile to come out.  Large slabs of marbled beef with a clean and mild soup taste.  The noodles were al dente and nicely flavored.  The tea egg was a bit overdone.  Overall not bad, but not a standout either.

Drinks:

5.  Peach green tea ($4.25 without bubbles) - very nice and strong tea taste.  Came in a beer stein.

6.  Bubblefish milk green tea ($4.75 with bubbles) - again, no artificial powdery taste here!  Funny that all the milk drinks were made with lactaid, but I wouldn't have known that unless I read the menu.  Bubbles were soft and chewy, and it came in a cute glass.

Overall, the sushi and drinks make this a standout place to treat yourself after a long and busy work week.  Perfect for hanging out at night with friends or with a significant other.  I want to come back and try the lunch special - 2 rolls for $7.95 (the normal rolls, not the special ones).  I also want to try some of the other things on the menu - the Tuna Avocado and dons will be my next targets!  So excited to come back!",2,"good"
"4","FIRST TIME: I went to Bubblefish yesterday with my friends before we all went to work. We made it in time for the lunch special! I got Spicy Salmon Roll and the Chicken Roll. The sushi was not amazing but it was not bad, the Avacado was great though! I also ordered a drink called Green Tea with Lychee, that was the highlight of my meal. If you ever go to Bubblefish, a must try is their drinks! My friends got the Coffee and Mango drink and it was amazing as well! The waiter came back and forth asking if everything was fine which was good! But collected my friend's plates when I wasn't even finished yet which made me rush a little. The layout is very nice and calm. When I look at the staff area, there was no sort of smile or communication. When I go in a restaurant, I like to see staff talking to each other, smiling, and enjoying what they do. Rather than that, I would recommend this place to other people!

SECOND TIME:
The waiter did not give waiter out right away. She came to take our order and we had to ask for water.
The waiter came and gave us the wrong order at first and gave us a Salmon Poke Bowl when I ordered a Tuna and Salmon roll. 
I got my Tuna Avocado roll and the avocado looks squished. They forgot my spicy mayo in which I had to ask for. The seaweed was really hard on the salmon roll. 
The spicy mayo was not spicy, it was more sweet. The Tuna avocado, one of it has no avocado on it just Tuna. 

My friends both got El and they both tasted multiple bones in it. One of my friend said ""it made me choke"". 

They gave us our tips and we payed and the waiters were talking to each other and one was on their phone and we were waiting for our change. The waiter walked over at one point and then walked back to waiter desk. 

We asked for change when we paid. The waiter took the money and went to cashier and did not give back our change until a couple minutes later. 

My friends and me were really frustrated. 

This place was not worth it this time I came. Contemplating if I should come back and write an updated 3rd review.",1,"bad"
"5","One star because of the experience (which I'll get into in a second, believe me you want to keep reading) TL;DR, this place BRUTALLY killed a MOUSE in front of my friends and me (using 3 different methods - fire, stomping, whacking with a broom)

Would have been a 2 stars regardless because of the food. 
#1 red flag was the fact that it was cash only bc the credit card machine was being 'shipped' from California, ok fine bc it had at atm machine there. 
#2 was when we asked about the Unagi vs fresh water eel don, the waiter said the menu is messed up but they're actually the same item (?) the Chinese translation definitely wasn't the same and they're very different types of fishes. 
#3 we asked for the ginger milk tea and was told we could get 30% sweet but then the waiter comes back and says they can't do it bc they use a ginger sugar (lol, ok) 
#4 they asked if we needed our tea pot to be refilled and we said yes but the waiter took it away and never came back with it until we asked multiple times.
ANYWAYS, with all of that said, the food just wasn't good, I had one piece of the eel and stopped eating and chucked it. The chirashi was just ok as well as the Taiwanese chicken. The calamari was too breaded and couldn't taste the squid inside, the rolls were too small and the waffle with green tea wasn't good. My friends and I really have NOTHING good to say about the place despite us going over the food/any redeeming factors over and over.

Now to the finale, this is what happened:
1) Friend notices a mouse in little space between outside and inside door 
2) We get grossed out but took a picture of it and immediately notified the management 
3) Management came over to take a look and ignored it for a good ten mins
4) Some bald guy goes outside with an iPhone (for light) and a FLAME THROWER (the kind you use to melt the top of creme brulee and tries to burn the poor mouse (WHY COULDNT YOU JUST USE A BROOM TO SHOO IT OUT as the first solution instead of trying to light it up?!) 
5) Man lights up the mouse's tail but mouse is too scared to leave (duh)
6) Man opens up the door and starts to use a broom and mouse runs back and forth and doesn't go outside bc it's hiding behind the ATM machine
7) Another guy comes out with a broom and tries to shoo it out and still it's not budging.
8) Finally mouse runs and the bald man traps it in the corner with his foot. Then he STOMPS ON IT 3x!!!!!! Instead of holding it with foot and just shoo it with the broom bc he was so pissed.
9) We record all of this and get super grossed out and sad that we thought they killed this little animal unnecessarily

BUT THERE IS A TWIST AND IT GETS WORSE.
10) Other man tries to sweep mouse out to street and mouse starts trying to run bc it turns out that the mouse was only seriously injured and not dead
11) THE MOUSE IS LITERALLY ON THE STREETS ALREADY, the bald man chases after it and whacks it repeatedly AS HARD AS HE CAN until it's dead.
12) The mouse is dead with its guts on the street now and he sweeps it to the mounds of garbage bags. PURE Brutality? I'm not a mouse lover but this story sounds pretty shitty, right?

HEY BUT GUESS WHAT THE STORY DOESNT END HERE.

13) The second man comes into the restaurant and has the NERVE to come over to us and says VERBATIM 'hey, the mouse came from the outside, not the inside. I saw you recording, can you delete...'
I CUT HIM OFF right away. I said also verbatim 'what's on our phones is our property and we will do what we wish with it, please give us the check'
Ok #1 what makes you think you don't need to apologize for us witnessing all of that? #2 why do you think you can ask us to delete our videos and pictures?! Doesn't even make sense!!!

THEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, they gave us a measly 10% off our bill thinking it'd be ok. We aren't asking for a free meal nor did we ask for any of this but if you're gonna comp anything, 10% is nothing. Please. A measly small apology when we were still at the restaurant before we just left.

I posted all the pics/videos as soon as we walked out  and have gotten an email from the owner. My friends and I have discussed at full length (like actually 1+ hour) on what to do and we decided that it was best to let the Yelp community what happened. It made us super sick, disgusted, and really upset after we left because of what we saw. Definitely one of the worse restaurant experiences we've all ever encountered. Not ok.",2,"bad"
