"2","Ok, I get lazy sometimes with my compliments--I think we all might--when it comes to shouting accolades. We have come to expect great service from the industry. Having said that, it's time people take the time to 'write' a ""thank you, how awesome an experience it was"" note on our social media platforms! I mean, 70 % of us spend an inordinate amount of time in these forums, checking in on friends, finding the next great movie or scoping out restaurants! Yet, so few people take the time to let the world know how great the restaurants, the movie or your friends are. Well, I've decided I want to tell people that I had a great experience at Mizu! I'm from out of town and needed a decent (and cool) place for dinner on a Saturday. Mind you, I was in town with 8000 other folks from our convention and we virtually overwhelmed the restaurants around The America's Center. I found Mizu about .3 mikes from the convention center and when I walked in, I noticed a large 20+ table! Honestly, I grimaced. But...wait for it... I was greeted immediately by the nicest, most professional hostess! She brought me an ice cold water, offered me her glasses (can't see a darn thing without mine which I left in the room!) and then she so courteously offered me a hair tie--hers! She could tell I was nearly melting on this 104 degree day! Anyway--the food? I had an ice cold Sopporo before I had ordered crab Rangoon. So good! Then she made recommendations--I chose the Sexy Girl roll. It's delish! Anyway, to make a long story short--EAT HERE. The service and the food were spot on. If you stop in, say HI to Sue. She owns it and after talking to her, I learned Mizu is the only restaurant that has been in this area--a truly local place--for the past 10 years. So, what's that mean? Great restaurants do last. Give it a try--you won't be disappointed. Happy eating!      #lifeisgood #livehappy",1,"good"
"3","Downtown can be dead on Tuesday nights, but that didn't stop Mizu from offering a wonderful experience with great food.

For some reason or another, a few of its servers were hanging outside. They smiled and one of them opened the door for us, which is surprising since that rarely happens for me Downtown.

Our server was very polite and offered us a seat at the sushi bar so we can see our food in action. At first, I thought she was just pawning off a two-top off to another server but she stuck with us to the end. Her knowledge of the menu and the genuine way she described her favorite items sold us on a Dragon Ball, which was supposed to be an appetizer, but can be eaten as a meal. It was a tempura battered, deep-fried monster roll that seemed more like a burrito than sushi roll... Until they let it rest and cut it into ginormous, futomaki-on-steroids slices. Inside was a mass of neo-sushi, spice-creaminess finished with a crisp. Lovely... But was a TON of food.

Thankfully, a cup of very strong green tea hit the spot after that kind of spicy madness.

We ordered a chef's choice sushi plate and unagi (eel) bowl. What I really liked was that the server suggested that we share the sushi plate and treat the unagi bowl like another course, which is what we normally do at sushi places but was a welcome understanding of the logistics of preparing sushi (fast) compared to the assembly of a good unagi bowl (more about that in a bit).

The sushi chef was friendly and let us take photos of him while he sliced his way into our heart via sushi, which was fresh and just above room temperature. The delicate nigiri and rolls were served on top of a drizzle of sweet soy sauce, which just the right amount to accent the fish and rice without dipping them into soy ourselves. 

Our unagi bowl was simply fantastic. Probably the prettiest unagi bowl in town in my opinion. The eel wasn't overdone and was a healthy portion. It was garnished with two large slices of VERY tasty tamago (japanese omelet), shrimp, seaweed strips, and a wonderfully seasoned rice (not my favorite sushi rice, but up there). My only concern was that the plate might have been a little too busy for what I might consider a comfort food.

Now, on to dessert!

Our server suggested that we get the deep fried green tea ice cream. Yes, it was more fried stuff, but hey, she was on a roll with her menu choices. When this ""dessert"" came out, I blurted:

""You're f***ing kidding me??""

She smiled and set down this bowl, containing a meteoric fried ball of green tea ice cream, which seemed to be coated in white cake batter, panko crusted and deep fried. Slice that in half for a dramatic effect and throw some whipped cream in there and you have yourself a COMMITMENT.

The only downside to Mizu is that while I love the way they're liberal with their portions, it's not what I want when I go out for sushi (most times). A sushi outing should be an appreciation of fresh sea food, and complete satisfaction. While I experienced both fresh and satisfaction, my distended belly made me realize that I over ordered. The next time around, I'll be more conservative on what I order.
