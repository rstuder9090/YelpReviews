"2","I add another location to my 5-star choices - the latest Wasabi location on Manchester in Warson Woods just west of Rock Hill and Brentwood.

When we arrived last Saturday before Valentine's Day at 6pm, it was a 45-min wait!  Wow!  We couldn't wait that day, but the hostess told us as we left that they do take reservations.  (I haven't made one yet, so I can't confirm this.)

So without reservations, we tried a slower night and were seated without a wait.  We started with the house green tea.  We received two cups, a sand timer, and a clear pitcher full of tea.  When the sand runs down, you're ready.  You place the pitcher on top of your made-to-fit cup, and it dispenses the tea from the bottom directly into your cup.  Replacing the pitcher on the table amazingly leaves no ring or moisture at all.  The tea was good with a particularly nutty smell and contained brown rice among the tea leaves.  Later, they did offer to refill our pitcher with more hot water, and it seemed like it wouldn't be an additional charge.

With an order of only 3 rolls, our salad was a la carte.  (The server mentioned it was possible to get soup/salad free with 4 or more rolls.)  I LOVE these salads with ginger dressing.

Then an appetizer of gyoza, which was perfectly done.

Finally, our sushi rolls arrived on a platter in the middle of the table.  Upon friends' recommendations, we chose the M&B II (with barbecued eel) and the Clayton from the ""Latest Menu Additions"" insert.  Both were very good.  The description for the Clayton mentions ""spicy"" but it's extremely tame, and that's coming from someone who tops out at Del Taco's mild sauce.

There was a 3rd sushi roll.  The local special at this location is called The Manchester, which we had to write in on our order sheet.  You can view the description on the sign near the front.  It is jam-packed with tasty ingredients, and we both liked it more than The Clayton or the M&B II.

If I remember correctly, the tea was around $5 and about the same for the gyoza.  I don't recall the salad price, and each roll was around $11.  They have less expensive rolls, but they just contain fewer ingredients and toppings.

Service was friendly and attentive.  Great experience!  Looking forward to coming back!",1,"good"
"3","We visited yesterday for the 10% off coupon. The food was great, and the prices seemed comparable (actually cheaper after the discount) with other sushi places in the area. Thumbs up! Free WiFi available. And there is this 'filthy fish tank' in previous reviews, pretty adorable fish...5/5

The place is decently decorated, with crystal, wood and china, and artwork on the walls, soft and warm light and pleasant scent, and the fish tank of course... It is a pleasing place to be in for relaxing when there are fewer people, but turns into insanely chaotic mayhem during peak hours, or when there are screaming babies or baseball fans yelling at the televisions. 5/5

Service 2/5. We have been here thrice. Our second visit (3 months ago), the hostess left immediately after we were seated, with nothing on the table. We had to flag someone down multiple times to get our chopsticks and napkins. There were only five customers and it took 38.4 minutes to make a Chirashi. We asked why we didn't get our miso soup she said 'Oh I'm so sorry, I just got here and I didn't know'. Yesterday, our third visit, the hostess forgot the miso soup also because she is newly recruited. Lucky coincident, we just discovered the identical twin sister of the hostess three months ago. 

Overall 3.626 rounded to 4/5.",2,"good"
"4","DO NOT ORDER CARRY OUT - ESP ON A FRIDAY! 

I'm 10x more likely to write a glowing review than vent (just check out my other reviews), but tonight's experience deserves a write-up.

let me break it down by the numbers: ordered at 6:46 on a Friday, 1 order Goons, 3 gyoza, 3 shrimp tempura, and 3 rolls. Was given order ready time of 30-40 minutes. Arrived and paid at 7:10pm. was told they were just waiting on the appetizers, the rolls were ready. At 7:30, I asked for an update, since I'd been waiting for 20 minutes and was now 20 minutes AFTER the ""order ready window."" Was told again that they were just waiting on my shrimp. TWELVE minutes later they show up with my shrimp. So my other fried foods (the crab rangoons and the gyoza) had been sitting in their containers for over 30 minutes and were now cold and soggy.

I asked to speak to the manager and spoke to the server who was filling in. I asked how they felt about sending me home with a half edible meal, half an hour after they quoted me it would be ready. I was told that was the best they can do, that carry-out orders get bumped and I should know for next time before I order on a Friday. Sorry, guess it's my fault for wanting an edible meal for $75 on a Friday night. They did offer 15% off my next order (which will likely never happen) and the real manager should call me soon.

But the punch line is that I arrived home at 8pm to a starving family with soggy, cold fried food and paid a lot of money for it.

We'd already stopped ordering from the Wasabi in Clayton because of their inability to quote accurate ready times for carry out and painfully slow dine-in experiences, but I think I'm through with Wasabi altogether. There are PLENTY of amazing restaurants, sushi and otherwise, in St Louis. Wasabi won't be getting my business anytime soon and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",1,"bad"
"5","I am the BIGGEST SUSHI SNOB in the world! I try and get my sushi fix at LEAST once a week if not more. 

This place used to be called SANSUI. Then before that, Ted & Teikos. Now... Wasabi. You would think that if another sushi restaurant would come in place of Sansui, it would live up to it's standards or be better. NO... not even close.

The fish is obviously not fresh, they put crunchy stuff and overload on sauce to cover up their bad fish smell. (you can still taste the expired fishy taste)

I usually order sashimi platters or sometimes nigiri. I'm not a typical maki eater but on occasion when my friends join me, we will order a maki or two. 

Even my friends that eat ALL COOKED sushi were disappointed. Just because you add fried batter crunch and sauces to a roll doesn't make it better. It's kind of gross actually. Might as well go to McDonalds and order a big mac and fries. The calories come out the same if you compare it to a wasabi special roll. 

I gave this restaurant 3 chances... tried their sushi at 3 different locations, but no, all 3 locations disappointed me. The rice they use on their rolls were just terrible. That is actually the most important part of sushi. They can't even get the rice right. 

I over heard staff also talk about how they just ""add water"" to dilute their soy sauce for low sodium. I don't ever use low sodium but my friends do, so to over hear that.. it sucks. 

When wasabi first opened their FIRST location on Washington Ave, It was awesome. Fresh fish, wonderful welcoming staff, good eats. Which is why I wanted to give Wasabi a few more chances, maybe the other locations would be better.... But no, Whoever owns Wasabi now, or if it is the same owner... whatever you are trying to do... you are making the name WASABI... into the category of ""FAST FOOD"" sushi. It sucks. They used to carry great selections. Now... no. 

 I rather go to the grocery stores and eat their cold sushi that has been sitting in their cooler than to ever spend a penny again at any wasabi location. 

note: if you are a chef at wasabi... when you take out your tuna, you should do it in the back, and not cut the frozen vacuum sealed pack of pink colored tuna. We know it's not fresh.... mostly because it's neon pink. 

also, we are a bunch of Chef's. So... it would be wise not to lie to us when we obviously know the difference between fresh and frozen. You can go to the International market down Kirkwood and find the same frozen pack of neon pink tuna that you all use behind your bar.",2,"bad"
