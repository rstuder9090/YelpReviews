"2","Newly opened on the 600-block of Central Avenue, Pacific Counter provides a fresh spin on lunch-on-the-go. The concept is essentially Chipotle for sushi (but note that the comparison begins and ends with the similarity in format!). You can create your own bowl or sushi burrito, picking from a variety of protein options, mix-ins, and toppings, all on a base of brown rice, sushi rice, noodles, or mixed greens, or a half-and-half mix of bases. Your food can be taken to go or eaten at their tall counter and booth seating.
The variety and quantity of options stand out as a major draw. There are 10 proteins to pick from, and you get to choose two (salmon, tuna, shrimp, calamari, tofu, chicken, and krab, as well as spicy salmon, tuna, and tofu). The choices of mix-ins and toppings (pick 5) are extensive and range from veggies and fresh fruits, slaws and salads, and kimchi, to typical roll toppers like masago, shredded nori, and sesame seeds. The eight different sauce options are all house-made with varying levels of spiciness. They also offer a small menu of ""Counter Creations"" - pre-selected blends of menu items, like one based off of the ingredients of a Rainbow California roll. 
Everything is $12, and the add-on prices for extra items are reasonable. It's a very affordable price point given that they're working with some generally pricey ingredients, doling out a hearty portion, and everything is high-quality, fresh, and delicious. With the variety of ingredients coming together in your bowl or burrito, it's certainly comparable to a $14-15 specialty roll at a sushi bar, except that you're getting a bigger portion, convenient packaging, and the ability to pick and choose all of your favorite elements.
The beverage menu is equally exciting, with alcoholic choices ranging from imported Japanese beers to sake slushies. The juice and tea options are housemade and looked divine - a honey hibiscus Palmer, and a matcha limeade stood out from a colorful lineup of choices.
What can, of course, make or break any business is customer service, and Pacific Counter is very much on the right track. Each of the three folks who handled my transaction (two to assemble, one to ring it up), was genuinely warm and friendly and projected a feeling of being happy to be there. They all seemed truly excited to be preparing delicious, healthy food for St. Pete.
Pacific counter is a bright, fun, unique addition to the DTSP/Central Avenue scene, and I am already excited to make my next sushi creation and try out a beverage!
I had a bowl to go with a brown rice/mixed greens base topped with salmon and tuna, cucumber, avocado, radish sprouts, mango, and masago with the citrus wasabi yuzu sauce. This sauce is listed as having mild spice; I didn't find spicy at all, which was good news for me as I'm very sensitive to heat. It was creamy, citrus-y, light, and flavorful.",1,"good"
"3","I was at a Rowdies game with my girlfriend when I saw the banner ads for Pacific Counter. Living in Tampa and not too familiar with some of the hotter or newer spots on this side of the bay, we decided to check it out after the game and, boy, did it NOT disappoint! 

We walked into a clean and bright restaurant, no long line and plenty of smiling faces eager to explain to me the menu options. If I worked downtown this would easily be my new go-to for lunch. The fact that it's open till midnight is an added bonus next time I come for First Friday (although I'll be coming here at any hour of the day when I'm on this side of the bay!).

The concept was simple: rolls or bowls. My coworker always talked about the concept of a Sushi-rrito and hyped it up as a rare treat that was hard to come by, so much so that the only time I've ever tried it was her homemade one. That was until we walked into Pacific Counter! I went with the roll since I was craving a Sushi-rrito and was super hungry (Over the Rainbow). My girlfriend went with a bowl (Land & Sea). Both were super flavorful and fresh. The best part was EVERY aspect of their menu can be customized, which is good for someone like me who's a little more mild with his spices and a girlfriend with dietary restrictions.

After our meal we tried their slush drink and, me being the indecisive person I am, they were able to swirl both the Saki and Ros√© together for an amazing adult beverage. On top of that, my girlfriend nearly had a heart attack when she saw they had Pineapple Dole Whip. We've only had this in Disney, so seeing this outside of Orlando was a shock. At only 80 calories a serving (I think?), it is the ULTIMATE guilt-less treat. If I could, I would eat that Dole Whip all day. 

All in all, what an amazing experience to stumble into this gem along Central! A fantastic concept full of delicious options and friendly staff. I will definitely be back and now have one more great reason to come to St. Pete! When will they be opening one up in Tampa??",2,"good"
"4","Like someone else said the positive reviews must be coming from people who have never had poke before. I've eaten here multiple times over the last 5 months - there is so few poke options in St. Pete I kept giving it a chance hoping it'd be better. Today I had to throw my bowl away after a few bites. 
First the sauce: All of the sauces I've had are just wrong, what's up with the consistency and flavor here? The light sauces are way too watery, the creamy sauces are 90% mayo overpowering any other flavors in the mix. 

The sushi: Today my salmon was very fatty and also I got two huge filet sized pieces that were cut almost all the way through into bite size chunks but instead, each little chunk was hanging on by a salmon thread just strong enough to hold the overall piece together, very annoying when all you have is chopsticks. 

The rice: overcooked. I don't know what they're using or what method to cook rice but it's somehow simultaneously, mushy and hard and dried out in other places. 

This place presents as poke, it looks like poke, they have all the right ingredients, but when you take a bite it's lacking the simple punchy flavors and expected consistency that make poke delicious.

I will say I hope they take these reviews to heart and try to improve because I'm desperate for a reliable poke fix! I won't be back again though until I hear differently from reviews.",1,"bad"
"5","The food was ok but the portions are not reasonable for the price.  The bowl is small (and I'm a 5'4 female and not a huge eater).  The other problem is the price is $12 for all bowls regardless of protein choice.  So we chicken and tofu eaters are subsidizing the bowls of those sushi-grade tuna eaters.  They really should have a lower price like $10 for chicken and tofu bowls.   They also barely give you any protein.  I had two tiny scoops of chicken., maybe 4 ounces total.  You would think at least they'd give you more chicken since your protein choice is cheaper but no.

The last gripe is that you only get 3 toppings and they counted a teaspoon of wonton strips as a topping.  Seriously?

The toppings are interesting and unique.  Seaweed was good. I love the glass noodles that I chose as my base.  They could use a little more mainstream variety.  For example the pickled carrots were weird. 

The spot is clean and welcoming and the teas are great, but as a non-tuna eater, I won't be back until the reprice the chicken bowls or adjust the portion size for chicken.",2,"bad"
