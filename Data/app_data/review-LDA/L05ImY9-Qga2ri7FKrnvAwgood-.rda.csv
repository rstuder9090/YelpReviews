"2","I was not sure about this place but my friend wanted to go. 
Disclaimer, I do not eat sushi - they always forget to cook it. (humor for anyone who has forgotten what that is). 
Seriously, I do not eat sushi so I am not reviewing the sushi. 
When I walked in I thought the place was a bit weird, it did not have any booths and it was quiet. 
The place was spotless, I love clean places. I am seeing more and more unclean restaurants lately. 
They were incredibly polite and patient. 
Most of the dishes were in Korean, or maybe Thai, actually not sure which language but not English. I did not know what the words meant, so my server explained the meaning of a few words. The fact that he explained five or six words made the experience so much better. 
I do not know how to explain this but the staff was ""present."" They did not seem to have anything on their minds but ""being there"" to help you. It was very nice. 
I ordered the shrimp tempura starter and a chicken dish with ""Amazing sauce.""
My friend ordered a tofu soup and a tofu dish. 
The tempura came with a sweet chili sauce that we both loved. 
I did not try her soup but she said it was very good. 
I loved my Chicken with Amazing Sauce. It was a peanut sauce of some kind but better than most peanut sauces I have had in the past. 
One thing to note, they only lightly cook their vegetables, they are very crunchy, if you are an older girl like me and want your vegetable more cooked, you need to request that. 
The portions were a nice size, I was satisfied. 
It is not only important how a meal tastes but how it makes you feel later on. 
I felt great after I ate this meal. Those healthy vegetables hit the spot. 
I want to add this to my list of favorites.

"3","5 of us including 2 kids arrived about 6:00 on a Saturday. The main parking lot was already full but plenty of parking on other side. However, some of those must have been employee's cars as there weren't quite that many diners inside. The decor is welcoming, very nice, looks and feels Thai. 5 stars for Thai ambiance. We were seated right away and several other groups came in as we looked over the menus. We had printed out some coupons from their website but forgot them at home. I pulled up the coupon on my phone and before we ordered anything we explained we had forgot the hard copies. The waitress said we could not use that, they had to be printed out. It's 2015, imo, showing your phone should be acceptable now. Also, NO kids menu which is very disappointing so plan on spending adult prices for your kids meals. 5 Thai teas, Crab Rangoon and Spring Rolls to start. Thai tea is so good and addicting as it should be. Rangoon was made with curry powder which I hadn't had before, it was different, and good. The (2) Spring Rolls were standard fare. Being our first visit there, and one of our groups 1st Thai experience ever, we both ordered Pad Thai. I know it's Thai version 1.0 but I like it. Their Pad Thai comes with 2 shrimp and chicken. It was quite good. I would say that the sauce however did not have quite as much flavor as others I've had. I've seen this before with Pad Thai, it seems the lighter the color, the less flavor. It's not a spice/heat issue either so maybe it's the ratio of fish sauce or tamarind? It was still good and I would get it again. My newbie decided to kick it up a notch with the spice tray and she liked it. The wife got the Amazing, a peanut sauce dish which was quite different than the ""Amazing"" she gets at our usual Thai place. Not what she expected, she really liked it and would get it again. It was quite spicy though which was not indicated as such on the menu. One of the kids ordered their usual sushi rolls which they said were really good, but not quite as good as they had at Jimmy's last week. The other ordered the Broccoli entree with Chicken. That dish was made with Royal Oyster sauce and we asked for it on the side, we also asked to substitute baby corn for carrots, all of which came out as requested. The broccoli was cooked perfectly with good flavor, and the kid even dipped the chicken in the oyster sauce which was also very good. I would totally order that dish for myself next time. Being a party of 5 they automatically add 18% gratuity to the check which totaled $106. That may sound expensive but we didnt order any expensive dishes. It adds up though, Thai teas are $3.00 each, we ordered 2 appetizers, and 2 sushi rolls, and one kid who we can normally feed for $5-6 had to order an $11 adult meal. Overall the atmosphere, food and portions were very good, the service was decent, and it was a nice dining experience. We will go back. 4 stars is my highest rating for a restaurant like this as I reserve my 5th star for rare incredible experiences and/or very high end establishments.",2,"good"
