"2","Ended up with a menu for Poseidon on our steps and decided to give it a try for dinner; however, would love to go back for lunch because the lunch special seems like a great value (2 rolls, soup and salad for $8.50).

We spoke to our waitress a bit and she said they have had a slow start, I am not too surprised, since there are so many well known places on St. Charles and Poseidon is a bit set back from the street. I'm sure they'll be packed just because of their location during mardi gras. Try it before then!

We had three rolls and they were all delicious. St. Patrick, Snow White and a Salmon Avocado. We also started off with the Sushi Tower.  I would highly recommend all of them. The fish tasted fresh, the rolls were large and moderately priced with different sauces - you didn't even need soy sauce.  Our waitress was new but made good suggestions throughout our ordering.

The one thing I will say is I'm not sure if they know what they're trying to be. The sushi was very good, and I think they could succeed if more people knew about this place as a sushi joint. The problem is they also have very random other things on their menu like shrimp pasta and a caprese salad.  Even the oysters are a bit random, especially when there are so many places around known for them.  Also as another reviewer mentioned, the boots are so strangely designed so you have to move them before sitting down - not a deal breaker especially if they aren't crowded, but awkward none the less. 

Give it a try! Stick to the rolls. Very good.",1,"good"
"3","Rented out a room for a karaoke night with family and friends and it was a great experience. I showed up to the place a week before our karaoke night and the staffer there let me inspect all the rooms and answered any question I had. She let me preview the microphones, karaoke system, WiFi, everything. Hospitality like that goes a long way. I ended up booking a 15 person room which comes with a $30 down deposit and you have to pay $250 overall in drinks and food before the end of your night. With 15 people, that was very easy to do. Note that depending on the amount of people in your party, the prices will vary. Also, some places with private karaoke rooms charge you a room charge on top of your food/drink expenses, Poseidon does not. And that too, goes a long way! My family and friends had a great time. They provide two microphones. The karaoke machine they provide has a lot of songs from international artists you likely won't know. The best way is you use their wifi and connect your phone to YouTube app and it'll sync to their TV and you can just pick your songs and add to the queue from the YouTube app (and you can still use your phone throughout the night to text, record, social media, etc. The YouTube app will not need to be open the whole time). The food was good. Albeit, I'm not a sushi/Chinese/hibachi expert so I'm easily impressed. I enjoyed my food and drinks though. My cousin remarked the oysters were amazing.

The staff was also great. Even danced a bit to our horrible performances haha. I would definitely recommend this place for groups looking to have a fun night and do karaoke. My family and friends and I can't wait to go back and do it again. They also have no problem splitting the bill by party which again, goes a long way! This place gets a 5 star alone for their hospitality but their karaoke rooms/equipment and food match their hospitality just as much!",2,"good"
