"2","The seating is falling apart on the surface and could really use replacing, but the quality of food will keep us coming back. We used to go to the Sushi Ai on Dorsett in MO, but their quality started heavily declining and wasn't super to begin with, so we stopped going there. We were in the area of this location recently and feeling sushi, so we stopped in and were wowed with the quality so much that we came back some weeks later (a 30+ minute drive) with the same result. 

The service was fantastic the first time (literally one other customer that time--probably 2PM on a Saturday) and above average the second time (busier--weeknight evening)--we did have to ask again for an item and there was confusion over who's plate was whose when he brought a plate and said the incorrect name of the sushi, resulting in the person asking for hot sauce, because it was supposed to be made spicy only to realize the plates at been mixed up after the hot sauce was added. Due to the mistake and now having two spicy rolls and no not-spicy roll, they made more not-spicy sushi fresh and allowed the person who likes hot sauce to take that ""ruined"" sushi home without being charged for it. 

We love the food; lots to choose from, though the entire sushi menu is not on the AYCE menu. But unlike the Dorsett location, this one has a couple types of chicken entrees (in smaller but still decent size quantities) on the AYCE menu as well as tempura (fried) oreos--yuuummmm. I am regretting doing this review now, because I want to go back for more now! I'm specifically a fan of the yamasa roll, the eel nigiri, and my husband likes this miso soup more than any other place he's had it. We love the shumai and sweet and sour chicken, as well. The California roll is also good. My husband likes the Philadelphia roll and some others I don't remember. 

There is a different all-you-can-eat price for weekend and weekday as well as lunch for both weekend and weekday; weekday lunch cheapest and weekend dinner most expensive. Definitely not cheap for weekend dinner, but it's AYCE and very good. You do have to pay for what you do not finish, so don't order a ton up front. You can keep placing orders for more.",1,"good"
"3","If you like any of the Sushi Ai's in the St. Louis area, you then will also like their metro-east cousin!  The menu is identical. Simply great AYCE sushi. The price here is a little higher than in St. Louis. I can't explain that, other than cost of product on one side of the river versus the other. But nevertheless, the quality and taste is exactly the same; excellent!

There is one thing about this Sushi Ai that I must admit I don't care for. That is, it's collocated with a Chinese take-out joint. I get it. It lends great cost efficiency to the operation (a single restroom, single soda fountain, single kitchen, etc). But the odors associated with Chinese food (many fried menu items), tend to ""bleed over"" onto the sushi side of the operation. I really don't want to smell fried Chinese food, while I'm consuming delicious sushi!  But the food is so damn good and reasonable, I can overlook this minor inconvenience rather easily.

The price difference between the lunch AYCE is $12.99, versus $19.99 for dinner. At this $7 difference comes a considerable difference in the items offered.  The best sushi and rolls, as well as additional appetizers are only offered as part of the dinner AYCE menu. The good news is, if you really have to have that Volcano Roll (dinner item, and my personal favorite), they will let you order from the dinner menu for lunch, but you'll be charged the dinner price. To me, when in a sushi mood, the price is worth it!

Decor is basic Japanese. Nothing extravagant; looks more like a fast food joint than a sushi bar. It's kinda' small, so bigger crowds can be difficult to accomodate.  The rest rooms are small, but clean. This isn't a date spot. But it's a great place if you really feel like getting your sushi on!

I'll be back, again and again!",2,"good"
