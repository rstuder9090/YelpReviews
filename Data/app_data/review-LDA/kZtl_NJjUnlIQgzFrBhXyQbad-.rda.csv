"2","I've been here a handful of times and I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed it. Well, I'm making amends now!

The first time I came, I came alone, when I was interviewing for my current job, at the recommendation of a friend who used to live here. I sat at the sushi bar and had a nice relaxing evening.

I introduced another friend here, and it was good. So good, she's practically a regular here. We came again tonight and one of the ladies already had a pile of ginger that she gave to my friend. 

Tonight we had the Spider roll, Caterpillar roll, spicy tuna, spicy scallop and a salmon roll. I also had a miso soup, as my friend kept talking about making miso, and I was starving, so it was a nice opening to the meal.

The fish was fresh and tonight's favorite for me was the salmon roll. It is a basic roll with salmon and avocado. Can we just say ""YUM?!"" The salmon was awesome and there was just the right amount of avocado in every bite. 

Second up was definitely the Caterpillar roll. Clearly, I'm a fan of avocado, but this was just so good! The other rolls were pretty good, but didn't stand out as much as the two that I just described.

I enjoyed the miso as well. I don't know why I don't come more often. Something tells me that that's about to change!",1,"good"
"3","The aura of great authenticity that Ichiban surpasses is beyond me. From the darling Japanese styled seating area, to the swords decorating the entryway, Ichiban is the most authentic Japanese dining experience I've had in Santa Barbara.

THE STAFF- 

The first few times I visited here I would use either an Axxess deal or a Groupon and the way the waitress would calculate the receipt would always be off by a few $$. I do think businesses should honor their deals, and it's a shame on their part because it would have been five stars.

Other than receipt miscalculations for deals, their staff are very quick and insightful, I'm never having to track down a waiter or if I'm at the Sushi bar, I never feel like I'm pressed for time.

THE FOOD- 

Lately I've been begining my sushi endeavours with fresh-water eel ($8.00) sashimi or nigiri, and it always falls palatable to the start of my meal.

I really enjoy their Mesa roll ($12.95), 007 roll ($13.95), and their mouthwatering Chef Special roll ($18.75). All of them come with a lot of spicy mayo so there's really no need to ask for a side of it.

Ichiban is one of the best Japanese restaurants in SB, in terms of food quality, and real Japanese authenticity. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",2,"good"
"4","I did not get the sushi here.   Refer to other reviews if you want to know about the sushi.  Looked up ramen on yelp and found this joint.   We ordered the pork ramen and the udon (the one with chicken and an egg).  Both were not good at all.  The ramen was salty and the pork was chewy with some weird taste to it.  The udon was purely noodles with a little bit of other ingredients.  The menus smelled like they were wiped with old wet towels.

My biggest issue with this place is the service.  I had looked at the menu wanting udon (the one you'd expect would have broth).  I accidentally ordered some other type that was dry with sauce instead.  When I told the waitress that I wanted one with the broth, she just kept explaining that I ordered one that didn't have the broth.  Well duh, I can see that I made the mistake since you brought out one without broth.  She was not helpful at all.  The dish did not smell appealing at all so I definitely didn't want it. I ended up just ordering the one with the broth, waited forever for it, and still had to pay my original order.  I basically took it togo, tried a little the next day to find out that it did not taste good just as I had expected, and threw it in the trash.  I have never been to a restaurant that didn't let you return something you didn't want.  I walked out very unsatisfied.",1,"bad"
"5","Overview: 5/10 atmosphere, 3/10 service, 7/10 food

I've come here a couple times at off-dinner times (first around 5:00 pm, second time around 8:00 pm) on weekdays. Average looking storefront with the choice of table seating or sushi bar seating. The tables a bit cramped, especially the two person tables, and it isn't a particularly group friendly place. The room is crowded and smaller tables are uncomfortably close to each other. 

Seems like a family business, or at least I hope it is because a few of the waitstaff are downright rude. Every single thing you ask them for--be it water, chopsticks, extra ginger for gods sake--is a huge favor they're imparting to you. Don't even bother waiting for your server to take your food and drink order; call them over unless you want to be there for a couple hours or more, since the food also takes a while to prepare. This would be one thing if it was the best sushi in town, but it most certainly is not. Fish is fresh, but it is at pretty much any other mid-priced sushi restaurant in a 7 mile radius due to the town's location. Both times I've come neither toro nor uni we're on the menu...we're in Santa Barbara! Uni is shipped internationally from this city, you'd think a local restaurant could manage to have some on hand. Their specialty rolls are heavily covered in baked mayonnaise and overly battered and fried. So, go simple the next time, I thought. I ordered a spicy scallop roll, a salmon skin roll, and soft shell crab to split. Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab. They were out of salmon skin, which would have been OK if they'd told me from the get-go. Instead, they brought my other food out and said they were out of salmon skin. Great, now if I order another dish it will come out later. 

Instead, I'll finish my food and come back never.",2,"bad"
