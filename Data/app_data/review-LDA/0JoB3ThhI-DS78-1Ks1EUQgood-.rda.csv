"2","I don't live anywhere near this neighborhood, but sometimes when I'm feelin' like a good jaunt and night drive around town is in order, I like to scope out new places. As the name tells you, call head and grab what you'd like to-go. The establishment itself is clean and no frills. Even with it being located near a busy, street-parking-is-hard-to-find intersection I was in and out in less than 2 minutes.

The prices are crazy delightful, the service is prompt and courteous and the food is pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken and shrimp teriyaki ($7.45), a specialty sushi roll ($8) and a side of kani salad (~$4). It wasn't the best teriyaki I've ever had, but it was hot, had good flavor with plenty of chicken and shrimp. The sushi roll was DELICIOUS and the kani salad was tasty as well.

This is a great spot for those nights when you might have that serious hibachi/sushi craving, but it's not quite payday. You'll be satisfied and fed in no time. Check 'em out!",1,"good"
"3","...and now, for a short play titled ""What Should We Have for Dinner?"":

Me: Sooooo... What should we have for dinner?
My husband: I dunno. Pizza?
Me: While my love affair with pizza runs deep, we had pizza yesterday.
My husband: Ummmmm... How about... PIZZA???
Me: (gives up, makes sandwich)

If you live in the area south of Snyder Ave., or what I like to refer to as ""the deep South"" of South Philly, you probably eat an ungodly amount of PIZZA. On just about every corner of every block of this neighborhood, you can stumble into one of many family-owned pizza and sandwich shops. Pizza joints are equally as prevalent in South Philly as our beloved corner bodegas and the word ""youse"". However, if you've already eaten pizza for dinner six times in one week and you are looking to add a bit of variety into your carb-loaded diet, give Hibachi 2 Go a buzz and order your weight in sushi for a fraction of the price of what other Philly sushi restaurants charge.

The first time my husband and I turned our backs on pizza and decided on a sushi feast from Hibachi 2 Go, we ordered four rolls and a salad for a little over $30. Some people may be skeptical of the combined words ""cheap"" and ""sushi"" and the words' ability to coexist without hinting toward possible gastric terror and a one-way ticket to botulism hell. However, we have ordered here five times since discovering this place, and with each order the sushi has been fresh and tasty, and we've lived to tell the tell and write a Yelp review about it. Hibachi 2 Go is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Now, if only they made sushi pizza... :)",2,"good"
