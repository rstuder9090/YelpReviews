"2","Hip, mid-century modern decorated sushi spot with some hits and some misses but overall a good time. 

Came with a party of 7 to celebrate my mom and aunt's birthday. We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. 

The drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. 

Things I'd recommend:
1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. 

2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. 

3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! 

Things I thought that were just OKAY: 
1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. 

2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. 

3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. 

Things I'd skip: 
1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. 

2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an ""omakase"" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. 

OVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.",1,"good"
"3","We heard about Tuna Bar when watching the news one night. They do sushi making classes, we definitely have to check it out! We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.
What we ordered: 

Chicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.

Eel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.

Spicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. 

Dragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. 

Dynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.

They weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.

 KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli

Also delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll

Rolls that weren't our favorite: 

Broad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. 

This was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.

Overall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint. The drinks were a bit pricy, so we just had a drink (a Sapporo for him and Prosecco for me).",2,"good"
"4","As you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with a very modern and eco friendly decor. The host greeted us warmly and took us to our table. However, this was the turning point in our dining experience. We ordered the Fried Oysters, J&J Roll, and 2 sets of the Large Omakase Sushi set. During our ordering process, we had asked the server how many pieces of sushi come in the small and the large sets for the omakase and they responded with 5 and 10 pieces respectively.

The fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.

The J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.

The omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.

Overall, for the price paid compared to the quality of service and food that you receive, I would not recommend this restaurant. I would give the Tuna Bar a 2/5.",1,"bad"
"5","Will never return.  I must have been to Tuna Bar at least 10 times last year.  However my last experience was the most atrocious experience I have ever had.  I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  

There were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.  The waiter did give us a $50 gift card as he did with others for running out of food.    I emailed the restaurant direct with no response.  DONE",2,"bad"
