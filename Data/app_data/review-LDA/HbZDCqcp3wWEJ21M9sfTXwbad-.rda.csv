"2","I did a to-go order right before 3PM, so they honored the lunch pricing. 
I ordered the shrimp pad Thai with egg roll (versus the salad option) and a Thai iced tea. 
I love Thai iced tea & this one hit the spot with the flavor & sweetness. 
The side egg roll wasn't anything special, but the dipping sauce (think similar to a sweet chili / sweet n sour) made up for what it was lacking. 
The shrimp pad Thai was fresh tasting & a good portion for the price. About 5 average size shrimp mixed in with the pad Thai noodles & other ingredients. 
I paid just over $12 for the meal & drink. 
Friendly, fast & efficient. I'll be back!",1,"good"
"3","EASILY 5 STARS for OUTSTANDING Thai food; a HUGE variety of foods offered; LOWER than average pricing; & EXCELLENT service. This locally-owned restaurant has been open ten years. Open seven days weekly, its hours are all over the place (& sometimes split), so check before you make the drive.  

This is a restaurant whose dining area is essentially three separate rooms. There are tables, but also very comfort  booths-- see pics. The interior was clean & organized. Potted orchids are on display & for sale-- see pic. 

The menu is B---I---G. We decided to sample two appetizers, two entrees, & one desserts. We also took home Crab Meat Soup ($4.95) & Kimchi ($6 for 24 oz). EVERYTHING WAS SPOT ON IN FLAVOR! The food pics speak volumes-- the Beef Pad Thai @ $10.95 was flavorful w/ the noodles cooked perfectly. The Tofu Bamee @ $10.95 was very good-- the Tofu & veggies so tender. The Spring Rolls @ $5.95 were the BEST either of us had ever had anywhere, & the Curry Puff @ $7.95, w/ its delicate flakey crust, was great. Both appetizers were accompanied by a delicious dipping sauce. The Kimchi was perfectly seasoned, & the Crab Meat Soup w/ its light broth, fresh veggies & fresh Crab was phenomenal. We shared the lightly sweetened Banana Coins @ $3.95-- so good! Who can resist fresh banana slices wrapped in wheat paper then deep fried & drizzled w/ honey. Yummy:) 

Some HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LARGE MENU are 5 Noodle Dishes that can include beef, chicken, pork, squid, shrimp, assorted seafood, vegetables, & Tofu; 10 Large Noodle Bowls that include Duck, Fish Ball, & many other proteins; 12 Macrobiotic foods; 5 Curry dishes; 10 Dinner Entrees; 13 Dinner Specials, including Sea Scallops, Soft Slell Crab, Grouper, & Salmon; 4 Thai Specials that include Whole Snapper & Frog Legs; 2 Sushi Specials; 13 Appetizers; 6 Soups; 7 Salads; 3 types of Fried Rice; 6 Desserts; Sake; Flavored Sakes; Red, White, & House Wines; & 10 Beers from the U.S., Thailand, Japan, China, & Holland. (There's also a Sushi Menu that I unfortunately did not photograph.)

The friendly, knowledgeable older woman who waited on us was an excellent server-- we couldn't have received better service. She quickly boxed & bagged our leftovers for us.

With PRICES SO REASONABLE & everything we ate simply DELICIOUS, I look forward to returning to try other offerings such as the Garlic & Black Pepper entree; the Panang Curry; the Chicken Satay; the Tom Kha Shrimp Soup; & the Mango & Sticky Rice dessert. I can only imagine how well those dishes are prepared @ this FANTASTIC Thai eatery!",2,"good"
"4","I was hoping that the few bad reviews were just blips, but my experience at this restaurant was not great.

Food: OK. We ordered a variety of dishes from both menus (sushi and Thai). Sushi was perfect and came out quickly. All other entrees ordered from the Thai menu were a mixed bag. All of them were generously portioned, but varied in under and over seasoning. They also came out an hour after the sushi. 

Service: Very inconsistent. I think this really depends on which waitress you get. Our table only got refills twice during the two hours we were seated, once when we were seated and once when we got the food. Our server only seemed to check in after we got the food.

Ambience: Fun, kitchsy, distracted me from the long wait...mostly

Bottom line: expect a long wait if you're eating with more than one person, and if you order off both menus. The kitchen can't seem to handle communicating with the sushi bar to time dishes being served at the same time. I would only order takeout from this restaurant.",1,"bad"
"5","This place used to be good... I've ate here a few times months ago and decided to stop in today. Our service was horrible. I didn't get my drink until my Main meal came out, then I asked for spicy mayo and that took 5 minutes to get. I used the soy sauce and it had a bug in not just the first one but the second one as well. I should have taken a picture but the lady quickly took them away. When mine and my friends sushi roll came out it wasn't even fresh. The double shrimp roll has fried shrimp, and the batter was hard and dry in the inside, and the shrimp wasn't even fresh. We automatically sent them back after trying it not once but twice. I'm not exactly sure what is going on here but I can promise you I will not be returning. I feel as if this place needs to be under some type of new management because this is NOT how you run a business or treat customers.",2,"bad"
