"2","I had been looking forward to trying Young Bin Kwan ever since I read about it here on yelp.  It did not disappoint.  

First, let me give a hint to those who are trying to locate it.  As previously mentioned, it is located in an apartment complex.  The name of the complex is The Colonade.  This complex is at the corner of Washington Lane and Township Line Rd.  Even though the address is 101 Washington Lane, you cannot see the restaurant from Washington Lane.  The sign and the restaurant are actually along Township Line Rd.  Hopefully that saves someone from getting lost as we did!

The decor is average, not very exciting.  But we weren't there for the decor--we were there for the meat!  What's exciting about a buffet for Korean BBQ is that you get to try a whole bunch of different meats for about the same price as only one type of meat at a non-buffet. 

The two women working there were friendly and led us to a table and immediately started lighting our grill.  It took a minute to get it going and she encouraged us to go get our food while she was fussing with it.

There was quite a spread of meat available.  We went for the Kalbi and bulgogi first, then followed it up with bacon, spicy chicken, tripe, whole shrimp, and octopus.  Everything was delicious.  The Kalbi was particularly good; well marinated and extremely tender.  The spicy chicken was also a standout.   I wanted to try the spicy pork, but we were just too full!  The bacon was my least favorite, only because it was not marinated, but I think that's how it's supposed to be.

Along with the meat there were a number of banchan.  There were 3 kinds of cabbage kimchi, all of which were good.  Two were medium spicy, the other was white.  There were bean sprouts, spicy scallions, and spicy-sweet cucumbers.  There was also soup, which we didn't have.  I understand from the other reviews that there would have been sushi if we went for dinner, but at lunch there was none available. We also couldn't find lettuce leaves, but the people who came in while we were finishing up seemed to find them, so we must have missed them. 

I liked that the women working there set up the grill and let us grill it ourselves--that's half the fun and sometimes Korean restaurants don't trust you to do it yourself.  

To drink, they brought out tea, there was coffee available, and there were cans of soda in a refrigerator that you could grab.  They also had some desserts, I think, but we passed on those and didn't get too good a look at them. 

Overall, very delicious and only 25 dollars each!  We are already planning our return trip.",1,"good"
"3","My wife and I went there the other day and we had a blast.  We spent 46 for two people.  It was a steal!.  We usually spend at least 55-60 if we get 2 or 3 orders of Kalbi so 23.00 a person was an incredible price.  The food tasted great.  If you're Korean, It's worth it!  If not, go anyway and stick to the rib meat.  Usually 4 pieces of Kalbi is 40-50 dollars so what you get here is a steal.  If you're Korean, there is Pork Belly unmarinated and marinated, bul go ki, marinated squid, A crock of Mi Yuk Gook and a Crock of Jigae, All you can eat Marinated Scallion, Kim Chee, marinated Tripe, it's a varitable feast.   As far as korean places go, this place can't be beat.  Go, keep this place in business so I can go there again.  Well worth the drive from University City!  By the way, it is BYOB, but, there is a way to get some Soju there.  Shhhh...  Gotta speak Korean.   Only problem with the place is, that you can't get any thing else like mak gul li or a good OB, Kirin, or Sapporo, and its hard to find those to bring.

By the way, Young Bin Kwan was a terrible Korean restaurant with really bad food in the same place.  The place is really called Seoul Garden now, they just haven't changed the Sign in the parking lot.  Youn Bin Kwan must have sold a while back.  We used to go there all the time when it was called Nul Bom about 10 years ago but stopped when they sold and changed to Young Bin Kwan about 7 or 8 years ago.  now that Young Bin Kwan is no longer and Seould Garden is in its place with great Korean BBQ, we are going to start going again.",2,"good"
