"2","I think this Valenica location has a pretty good benefit by being near the airport.  It gets a lot of traffic on the whole and I believe that really helps in keeping the fish very fresh.  Here in the desert, we can use everything we can to help get fresh fish!

Aki-san is a chef that came over from Sushi Garden (yes he knows Seki-san at Sushi King, they both worked together at one point).  Aki-san is on the left (customer perspective) and is the one that can't stop moving.  The head chef I actually don't know his name yet.  I always refer to him as the ""surfer chef"" though with my coworkers as he frequently wears a Billabong shirt under his chef shirt and the logo on the back is sometimes barely visible when he turns around.  He's also pretty young (30ish?) for a sushi chef and I can picture him on a board.  That said, Asians have that whole ""I look way younger than I really am"" thing going on, so he's probably really like 50 or something.

I try to vary up sitting in front of both to get both experiences.  Aki-san is really good with nigiri-zushi.  The surfer chef is really good with nigiri-zushi and maki-zushi.  The tamago here is always good.  Aki-san will warm it up a bit which I think makes it even better!  If you like to go tempura with maki, try the Vegas Roll.  I think Sachiko restaurants make the best Vegas Rolls.  Hamachi/yellowtail is always fresh and good, they also have hamachi toro here and give that a try if you haven't yet.  Buttery goodness!  They usually have aji/spanish mackerel too.  It's not marinated like typical saba/mackerel.  It's raw and very fleshy and still has that mackerel taste to it.  Usually dressed with ginger.  Very delicious.  Saba is also good here.  Quality can vary a bit on the Saba, but almost always really good.

Portions at Sachiko restaurants have a tendency to be a bit on the large side.  But still usually one-bite sized, just with some effort!  I think a lot of people like larger portions, and this is probably a good middle ground for traditional purists and value minded folks alike.

Andy: I think you mean the Wilmot location.  This Valencia location is a bit more expensive, I think 3.50 for salmon.  And Wilmot has the projection TV.  Valencia only has a small ~20"" TV above the refrigerator behind the bar.",1,"good"
"3","I've been here a few dozen times, and its growing on me.  The short of it is, it's better than average, and you could do a whole lot worse in Tucson, but not much better as far as sushi goes.

The sushi prepared at this site is adequately balanced, rice vs fish, its always fresh, and its reasonably priced.  The service is pretty good, the majority of the time efficient, but when I'm in a hurry, I just tell them I'm in a rush and ask them to assist me if they can.  In every instance, they've been really fast and accommodating.

Nothing in particular sticks out, but they do a good job of preparing food to go, and the specials plastered to the little desk as you walk in and behind the sushi counter offer some good deals.  I find whatever boat specials they have to be incredibly generous for the $12 or so they usually cost.

So if you are on the south-side and looking for a healthy alternative, I recommend giving this establishment a try.",2,"good"
"4","DON'T GO! One star because the only roll I ordered was mediocre at best. You don't get seated and no one tells you it's open. Then when they watch you sit down they have no care in the world to serve you. We waited for what felt like an unreasonable amount of time until I finally started timing it on my phone. 9 minutes, 17 seconds until I got up and asked for two iced green teas. I stood there while she filled them and handed them to me to bring back to my table. Mind you this is a sit down restaurant and I'm serving myself. Apparently they serve miso soup for free with an order, we already finished our sushi before the woman brought the miso. My friend pointed to a laminated picture on the wall to which is considered a ""menu""? When an octopus salad came out she asked what that was. The manager argued with her telling her that's what she ordered..... It was not what was pictured or had the same description. No language barrier excuse when you're the manager and she points to the menu advertisement picture. As she was explaining that to him he stormed off from her in the middle of her sentence. She wrote 2 on the sushi sheet for her salmon sashimi. He brought one. When she asked for the ticket the 2 was scribbled out. This entire process took almost 2 hours (we only have an hour lunch) when explaining we needed our check quickly even willing to pay for the horrible food fiasco because we were late he snapped back saying ""it's okay"". Mind you next to the airport and no sense of respect or urgency for people on time schedules? I will never even look at this place again. I'm utterly disgusted by the way we were treated and disrespected by his making us feel like we were a disservice when the entire experience was terrible on their end.",1,"bad"
"5","Having dined at many Japanese restaurants all over this country (including Hawaii) and in other countries including Japan, there is very little that is authentic about this restaurant. Upon entering its appearance is that of an old diner with old furnishings, tired decor and two large screen TVs. The ""chefs"" were standing behind the counter chewing gum and watching TV. (Totally unprofessional!) That should've been our first clue to leave. We decided to stay and give the food a try. The miso soup was the best part of the meal. It was good, but not the best we have ever had. The sushi was poorly sliced and not well presented; something a good Japanese chef would ever do. The scallops were rubbery and overlooked with way too much raw garlic. They were served with a pile of flavorless vegetables and a huge glob of pale, undercooked, flavorless potato salad. The Japanese do not serve potato salad with a meal and these folks shouldn't, especially because they don't know how to make potato salad! It would've taken a steak knife to cut through the huge hunks of uncooked end potatoes.
Overall, a poor experience and one we won't repeat. The Japanese chefs pride themselves in flavorful food with beautiful presentation and excellent knife skills. Don't waste your money on this place.",2,"bad"
