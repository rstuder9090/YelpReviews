"2","This unassuming little place in Glassboro, NJ, of all places, is probably now my favorite place to go for Chinese food, now that House of Chen is closed in Chinatown.  I know, bold statement, right?  It's actually Asian fusion, as they have a mega-extensive menu of Chinese and Japanese staples.  I don't eat sushi, but from what I've heard from my co-diners, this place's sushi is very good, and they even have an all-you-can-eat sushi night on Wednesday (I think, unless they've changed their tune recently).  The food is good, the price is right, and the service is outstanding.  It's definitely a treat for those of us stuck living in South Jersey, but with Philly-style tastes.      

This is going to sound stupid:  All of their food is really delish, but my favorite part of going to Tokyo Mandarin - Their white rice.  I swear.  It's just SO good.  I don't know why... it's just the right amount of sticky.  And oh so good.  Mock me if you will, but I purposely order things that come with a side of white rice (most of it does, but I always make sure).

I discovered this place while I attended Rowan back in the day, and I like to venture back every now and then with the BF for some yumness.  For being on a college campus, I've never really seen it super packed, and there's a good mixed demographic in there, not just a bunch of frat kids all the time, so that's nice.  Very cheesey decor, in a good way, and they have cute little booths to one side with pillows and stuff - very Asian-y.  Tokyo Mandarin is definitely a good time.",1,"good"
"3","Another Yelp success story. With a 3 hour wait for a wedding reception, three of us decided to nosh on some light food. But after tasting just one roll, I really wanted to just go for it and order several more.

Lunch specials were offered even on this Saturday, and we all spotted things that appealed to our individual tastes. $8.95 gets you a nice sized entree, with traditional Japanese as well as Thai and Chinese options. And to start we were each served a bowl of very good miso soup.

I had to try at least one roll, and as I said, really would have loved to get more. My selection was difficult, some recognizable choices, but some unique ones as well. Mine was called rock n roll and was a perfectly constructed Maki with shrimp tempura and something else(?) in the middle, on top was avocado, crab and bonito flakes. We all enjoyed it.

My gf ordered shrimp pad Thai, it was good, every ingredient was fresh, and I was surprised that a sushi place could recreate it do well. Our friend picked shrimp in lobster sauce, again very nicely done, I didn't taste but it smelled and looked very good. I had to go Bento box, nice cold salad with the best carrot ginger dressing I've tasted, spicy tuna roll, chicken teriyaki and rice. I enjoyed every bite. Something sweet was required to end such a good lunch, so I suggested green tea ice cream. My companions were not familiar with it and agreed to try. This was possibly the best example of this not too sweet treat I've ever had. Much darker and flavorful than most restaurants serve. We agreed that is was a great way to end.

The decor is very nice, and spotlessly clean, including restrooms. My only regret is that we could not eat more. I can see coming back here and just really hitting the sushi and sashimi hard, but saving room for the perfect GT ice cream. 4.25 let's skip the wedding food and just pig out here Yelps",2,"good"
"4","I just left Tokyo Mandarin for the second time tonight. We order from here often and eat in only occasionally. The food is usually delicious and the service is typically decent. We've eaten here for years and have never really had a problem until tonight. I placed an order over the phone with no issues. The hostess even confirmed one of the menu items by partially repeating it back to me. I picked up my order, paid $50, and drove 15-20 minutes to my parents to eat our meal. Upon opening the bags we realized we were missing an eggroll (part of a combo) and an entire dish. If it were just the egg roll, I would have let it go. But the other item was my mom's entire meal. I called and explained the situation. The hostess said I wasn't charged therefore I'd have to pay. I explained to her that I'd appreciate it if she could complete that portion of my order ""on the house,"" considering she repeated part of that specific item to me and I'd now be driving 30-40 extra minutes and missing the majority of dinner. She agreed to do so. When I arrived however, I was ""greeted"" by a man whose first words were that he'd give me the eggroll but not the meal because it wasn't on my reciept. He proceeded to show me the receipt (that I clearly did not understand because it was written in Chinese or Japanese). He stood there and argued with me for a good 5 minutes. I explained to him and the hostess my situation again, and that I understand (I've worked in food service and retail for the past 14 years) but for the inconvenience, of driving, alone I should be comped. After all, a business should want their customers to be happy, right? I dont think i was asking too much.  He finally, hesitantly, agreed so then I had to stand there and wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for the dish to be made. They had my phone number from my original call. After the hostess discussed with whomever the man was, I should have been called and notified that they were expecting me to pay, especially knowing how far/long I was driving to get there. The man returned with my dish, I kindly thanked him and told him that I appreciated the gesture and to have a good night. I received no response other than, ""no problem"" (but clearly, it was). AND no eggroll. At that point however, I was too hungry to sit there and argue any longer. Overall, I am very disappointed in my experience tonight (the first time in a long time) and will greatly reconsider recommending or patronizing this establishment in the future.",1,"bad"
"5","My previous review is for the location before the fire. After they rebuilt it's been nothing but disappointment.  

First disappointment, the size.  The place is so cramped now, so all the tables are too close together.  When it is crowded you are way too close to other people to enjoy yourself.  Privacy? What's that? Doesn't exist here when there's a lot of people.

Second disappointment, staff change.  Everyone who used to work here, save for 1 person, no longer works here anymore.  Apparently it's owned by a completely different group of people now.  My third disappointment below proves this as it is a policy change to how their specials work. Typically happens with new ownership.

Third disappointment, Price and Specials.   Wednesday all you can eat sushi? Gone.  Replaced with 50% off sushi on Wednesdays.  Now that might seem like a good deal, until you realize that they jacked up the prices of all their sushi alongside the deal.  I have a menu that had their prices before the fire, all the rolls are at least $1 more if not higher.   So they do 50% off but it's on rolls that used to cost way less.  So in the end you're really only getting about 25% off if you consider what they used to charge for the same product, and this isn't from inflation either because their prices are expensive compared to every other sushi restaurant in the area (trust me, i've shopped around after the changed their sushi special).  They really jacked up their prices! $6.50 for ONE spicy tuna roll.  That's outrageous.  Compare that to Tomo down the street who charges $4.50 for the same roll.  It's just not a good value.  

This is a tactic a lot of stores use and it seems Tokyo Mandarin is employing the same tactic.  Add a special price but jack up the base price and it looks like a better deal than it actually is.  

Now don't get me wrong, this deal has a niche.  It's still going to be about 25% cheaper than what you would've paid for their old prices if you were paying full price (not getting any kind of special) But the thing is, this deal is NOT for those who have an appetite.  This is for people who are content to eating just 4 or 5 rolls and calling it a day.  That is not me.  I am not that kind of person.  This deal is not good for me. 

I am the kind of person who typically eats upwards of $60+ worth of Sushi and that's at prices that are lower than Tokyo Mandarins.  I go to Tomo and I easily exceed $60 worth.  If I were to order the same amount of rolls as I normally do at Tomo, but at Tokyo Mandarin,  I'd be spending around $80+ 

So instead of paying what I used to pay at Tokyo Mandarin when they had all you could eat for $23 I would end up spending $80+ and then cut that in half because of 50% off and I am left with a bill of $40+ for the same amount of food that I used to eat from this place.   Almost double the price that I used to pay when they had their old $23 all you can eat special.  

Just not a value for those of us who have an appetite.  You individuals who are happy with just eating a few rolls?  You all are fine.  You're good.  You can come here and get value.  But for anyone who eats more than like 8 rolls? Not a great spot to consider.   Find an all you can eat location.  Personally I've taken a liking to Tomo down the street.  They have a better selection and it's all you can eat instead of just 50% off.",2,"bad"
