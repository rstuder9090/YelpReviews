"2","I have fun here when I'm back in town.  It's places like this that make me think that there still is some hope for a St. Louis scene of some sorts that doesn't involve aging frat boys wearing plaid shirts and baseball caps acting like, well, aging frat boys wearing plaid shirts and baseball caps.

Wed. night is 80's night. $1 PBR CANS. Now that's awesome.

The bartenders make strong drinks and they have a moderate selection of low to medium grade sakes.

The sushi was 3 stars. But hey, it's St. Louis and you are in the middle of a bar. What do you expect?

Def. worth a stop in if you are in the St. Louis area. It's not going to blow your mind, but it's far better than anything else in the vicinity that I know of.",1,"good"
"3","The first time I went to Rue 13 was for their 80's night where they have old music video projected onto the walls. Well, that's basically the only time that I go there. But when I do go, I have a blast. All my friends do as well. We're the people that you see on the dance floor the entire night making fools of ourselves and probably having way too much fun for any sane person.

Rue 13 is a fun place to go to besides dancing maniac to 80's music. They also have a nice bar where the alcohol just keeps flowing the entire night till the dreaded last call. In the back are some pool tables for those who enjoy pretending to be Minnesota Fats while they play a game of 9 Ball.

Rue 13 is a great place to go with a group of friends of any size. Each time that I go I have always thoroughly enjoyed myself, so I keep going back.",2,"good"
