"2","4 stars for above average sushi, good quality, and a great Pho station. 

Is Kobe's sushi better than Mikado's or Megu's? No. Is Kobe's sushi better than Sushi Kingdom's? You can bet on it, due to the freshness, & how you don't get horrible service here. 

This place is above good enough, compared to other Asian buffets. But it does follow the usual buffet flair: most items are OK quality, and some items are better than others. You will get good value for quality if you go now, because the place is still new. Typically food quality goes down in buffets over time, but you never know if this will be one of them.

So here's the breakdown:

Pro's...
* Many different stations: sushi, salad, fruit & dessert station; big ice cream station; large soup station; Hibachi & Pho station where they cook in front of you; American food station with pizza, fries, etc; multiple other stations featuring mainstream Asian items as well as more ""ethnic"" items; and a few specialty seafood items such as baked salmon and sea bass.
* Service was consistently good throughout all visits. Our plates were promptly removed, and our drinks were refilled at least once, as opposed to other places I won't mention.
* Like I said, some items are worth trying more than others. My faves are: the seaweed salad, hot & sour soup; salmon or sea bass; the potstickers (when crispy); the pho with seafood, curry broth and yellow egg noodles (very authentic), crab legs (dinner only), coffee ice cream, and their p√¢te a choux pastry (when available). I will say that the pho is so good, I could just come for that alone!
*On weekends, you'll find better service and freshness of foods overall. It gets pretty packed on Sat. & Sun.

Con's...
*Aside from the servers, everyone else working here seems to have a hard time with speaking English. I couldn't get any help anytime I asked for it around the restaurant.
*As with any buffet, any food under a hot lamp for over 20min will show a drop in quality. 
* Some of the items are undoubtedly from a bag, and any experienced foodie can tell by looking at the stuff.
* Any coupons that are expired (even from 1 day ago) will not be honored.
* Some of the items are just plain bad (ex: their pizza; their ice creams are definitely lacking flavor (ex: their green tea ice cream does NOT taste of green tea).

So I say check it out because for the variety and quality you pay for, you really can't go wrong with trying it out.",1,"good"
"3","I feel like I am just constantly seeing these Chinese seafood buffets up their game and this was no exception, raising the bar for buffets everywhere.

First of all, it's big and pretty. You're greeted with one of those waterfall-wall fountain-fixture things. With lights. Real pretty. There is SO MUCH food. There's a noodle and dim sum bar in the back, where you can make your own custom bowl of noodles. (ZOMG) There are 6 bars of food - seafoods, American food, fried foods, etc. There is a soup bar with TEN DIFFERENT SOUPS, a few of which are great Chinese dessert soups. There's the giant salad bar with SO MUCH DELICIOUS SUSHI and some great-looking desserts. And of course, a freezer full of ready-to-scoop ice cream and sherbet.

Second, the price is right. $13 for dinner for adults? That's fantastic for how much food there is and the quality that they're offering. Let me just run down some of the food I got:

- Fresh raw oysters - Definitely quite fresh, and you can easily get your money's worth from your meal just by getting these
- Snow crab legs - Okay I didn't get a chance to eat these because a) more work than I like to deal with when shoveling food into my mouth but also b) there was consistently a huge line waiting to snatch up a plate full of them. They would disappear fast
- Ginger scallion lobster
- SO MUCH SUSHI you don't even know and it was all so delicious
- SOUPS like taro soup, sweet red bean soup (dessert soups) and egg drop soup but also Maryland crab soup? DANG YO.
.... okay you get the idea? They take it to the NEXT LEVEL Y'ALL.

My only gripe would be about the fruit offered, but there was so much it was a miracle I was even able to eat any fruit afterwards. I was really wow-ed by the options available at this buffet. I can see why my dad dragged us here even though it's not on the way from my old home in Edison to my new home in Maryland.

ALSO our servers were super duper nice!",2,"good"
"4","I looked with anticipation when I heard there was another ""buffet experience"" coming to the area. The original $16.95 plus beverage seemed a bit pricey, the featured menu which included sushi, lobster,crab  legs, shrimp and other seafood items whetted our appetites.

We actually went for dinner on the day they dropped their price by $4 dollars, making it price competitive with other buffets...but sadly enough the food was not attended to, the serving dishes were filled with gummy, sticky food or severely fried food.

On the plus side ~the sushi display temporarily made up for our overall disappointment.In all fairness, we didn't try the noodle bar or the hibachi grill. The lobster in ginger sauce include some identifiable pieces of lobster. Another one of our favorites is coconut shrimp. It too was gummy and sticky. 

There are trays and trays of food, but regrettably so much of it appeared picked through with no efforts to refresh each platter. When we asked for bowls to put our discarded shells and peels in ~ we got a blank stare followed by a soup bowl. As we finished each plate, it was left unattended throughout most of our meal.

We eat Asian/ oriental food generally three times a week. The key to any successful restaurant is how its customers feel welcome and appreciated. The man standing behind the register never greeted or thanked us or anyone else for that matter. The hostesses were a bunch of high school kids who had no restaurant sense. Servers around the floor seem disinterested with one notable exception ALEX. He actually took the time to take my husband who is new to sushi on a ""sushi tour"" explaining the different varieties. His tip reflected his interest in making our most recent experience pleasant.

To sum  it up ~ the place to go is the RUBY BUFFET on Route 38 in Cherry Hill right behind Red Lobster. Consistently good food that is always being refreshed, accommodating servers and a management ~ RENEE, that lets you know she appreciates your business. It is the perfect example of quality; not quantity. 



We have been to KOBI twice for dinner and once for lunch.",1,"bad"
"5","2 visits, 2 reviews.  2 weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon the food was good, and service was good.  The buffet was stocked except for the crab legs so I didn't get the chance to try them.
Returned again this Saturday night at about 8pm.  Service was slow, they sat us at a dirty, sticky table.  After pointing it out to them they moved our family to a new table, which was also dirty.  The host and waitresses were no where to be found so we couldn't ask them to wipe down the table for us.  
Decided I wanted the crab legs this time.  There were only scraps in the tray.  While perusing the other items, they dumped half a tray of new crab legs into the buffet and I almost got knocked over by the large woman who grabbed the tongs and proceeded to empty 2/3 of the tray, while another man took the rest of them for himself.  I stood next to this lady waiting for my turn, but there were only scraps again when she walked away.
Both my son and I watched the buffet for the next 45 minutes while eating and they never filled the crab legs again.
On the first visit, the kind waitress would walk by every 5 minutes and ask how things were and if we needed anything, topping off our drinks 2 or 3 times.
On the second visit, the waitress that apparently didn't speak at all (just asked drinks and then never said a word after) never came by our table until she dropped off the bill - and then sat down to eat her own dinner a few tables away from us while we had to wait about 15 minutes for her to come over to take the credit card to pay the bill.  My wife and daughter went out and sat in the car while my son and I considered just leaving if they wouldn't come get our payment for dinner.
For the food, it was hit or miss.  I tasted a little of everything the first time and found my favorites.  This time I concentrated on larger portions of my favorites only to find that they were prepared differently and not nearly as tasty.  Last time the sushi was awesome.  This time the sushi was bland - or maybe getting old?
I thought I found an awesome buffet to go to on a regular basis, but now I will be hesitant to go back.  Management should try for consistency for all days and hours that they are open, and keep the crab legs stocked so I can try them!",2,"bad"
