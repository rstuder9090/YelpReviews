"2","I've been to Sushi House a few times and it has turned me into a sushi lover.  The first time I ordered a bento box which gave me a nice selection of everything: soup, salad, chicken teriyaki, rice, dumplings, and a roll.  On subsequent visits I decided to expand my palate and try the all-you-can-eat option.  I tried a variety of rolls and find something new I like every time I go.  The food tastes great and I find it better than another local AYCE sushi establishment.  It's a little pricier, but worth the money.  Kani salad and red bean ice cream are really good.  I highly recommend the crazy roll!

The only issues I've had with this place is that service can be slow at times, depending on how busy the restaurant is. I've seen people get disgusted and walk out.  Also, I'm not sure they've always included everything we've ordered when we've put in a large order.  

The decor of the restaurant is modern.  It can get noisy when busy, as it's a great place to go with a larger party.  Overall, the food is great if you're willing to overlook the few downsides.",1,"good"
"3","I read a lot of reviews about this place before going and it had a lot of bad and average reviews. I had low expectations going in about the service and food because of those reviews. Experiencing the place first hand, I think it is comparable to the other sit down order buffet places and a little better in some aspects. Let me say that the service and waitresses were not what the other reviews said. They do lack speaking English but they understand most of the things that are said. There were plenty of people while I was there but the waitress came over to constantly check on us. The kitchen menu is big and they offer things that others places do not like the kinia salad. I had to order the Yaki tori becaus I read from another review that the chicken was well done and rubbery. I thought it was moist and very tasty. 

The sushi is very good. Presentation is solid and the amount of rice they put on is not overbearing. If you order a lot and not finish, that is your fault. The sashimi pieces were huge! Usually when I go to a ayce place, the sashimi pieces are tiny but this place, they cut it very generously. 

If they are actually reading these comments, I gotta say kudos to them cause they've improved from what was written before. Another note is that they are a recent business. They're working out the kinks so to give them a bad review this early without any constructive feedback is unfair. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Will be going back if I want another ayce adventure.",2,"good"
