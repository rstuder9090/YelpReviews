I ended up getting a large poke bowl with scallops, spicy salmon, sushi rice sweet chili gochujang, sriracha aioli, and all the toppings, and crunch options available that did not cost extra. For my second complimentary large poke bowl, I got shrimp, ahi tuna, gluten free green kale noodles, wasabi aioli, and thai chili, and all the topping and crunch options available. Because it was the grand opening with an amazing promotion, there was a long line to order that extended outside the restaurant.  Staff did a good job in keeping all the toppings well stocked as they were quickly going through a lot of food and the line moved relatively quickly. Staff was pretty friendly and helpful in recommending sauces and explaining what is what. The line to order was about 10 minutes long and getting through the line and adding all the options took another 5 minutes. The serving size didn't look that big but ended up being very tasty and surprisingly filling. The ingredients were all very fresh and tasty. While the kale noodles are a novel concept, I still prefer the traditional sushi grade rice with my poke bowls because it absorbs the flavors of the sauce better and creates a more savory meal in my opinion. It was nice that staff asked if patrons wanted light, regular, or large portions of sauce with their poke bowl and mixed it in a separate bowl before putting it into the bowls.  I like my poke bowl saucy so I got a lot of sauce and it really hit the spot! The portion size is a bit smaller than U Poke Spot by USF but definitely a lot bigger than Poke Rose at the Hall on Franklin by Downtown. There are only 3 small tables that can fit 4 people each in this restaurant but you can always enjoy your meal at one of the tables of the food court next door if it is too busy. Overall, the bowls are a great value and very filling for a healthy meal. I look forward to trying more poke bowls and more sauces in the future soon!",1,"good"
"3","I just started going to these very casual poke places that move along a cafeteria type line, and I think it is such a such a quick healthy option for lunch in contrast to say, fast burger and fries.  The options are plentiful and basically as many toppings and accompaniments as you like, without being nickle and dimed for extras, except for avocado.  I selected spicy tuna and spicy salmon, and almost every topping, including seaweed salad, fish eggs, garlic crisps, and lotus chips, and a ponzu dressing. I  was even asked if I  prefer light, medium, or heavy dressing. I never had lotus chips before, and I can say not only did they have an appealing shape that lured me to try it, they were crunchy and tasty too, nothing weird.  I can say, I enjoyed every bite of my custom made bowl of fresh salad, and am happy this type of restaurant concept is spreading rapidly.  Even an employee stopped at our table to ask us if everything was okay.  My total for a 2 item protein with unlimited toppings was $10.99, plus tax and a couple in the tip jar at the register.  It's located near but not actually in the food court line up, and there are a few tables inside, but obviously plenty of tables in the food court adjacent.",2,"good"
"4","I'm a little bit disappointed that my food was under-portioned and didn't taste very fresh. I usually order poke from here because their poke bowls are very delicious and usually fills to the top of the bowls. However, when I received my order today and opened the bag, I noticed that the poke itself was portioned very little as well as the sushi rice. Also, taste-wise, some parts of the sushi rice was hard as if it wasn't cooked thoroughly and the ahi tuna did not taste fresh this time. 
I hate leaving negative reviews and I come here many times to grab lunch and they never disappoint but today, I was pretty upset that this was what I got after paying $12 plus taxes and delivery fees. I will think twice about coming here next time.",1,"bad"
"5","Probably the worse poke I've had. I shoulda looked at the fish before I started ordering. There fish isn't fresh. The salmon looks like it's been frozen once and it was sitting in a pool of defrosted salmon water. The salmon looks gross. I literally had two bites and throw out the rest in fear of getting worms from the fish. I've been to Pokeworks in California and the quality is much better. I'm not sure what's going on with this location and how they can serve this to people, but I think they need a health inspection ASAP.",2,"bad"
