"2","I'm trying to think of the last time I was nervous to eat at a restaurant because of the restaurant itself.  For those that don't know Sam at Sam's Sushi is known as being the ""Sushi Nazi"" of Nashville.   This reference relates back to an old Seinfeld episode where a chef running a soup kitchen would yell at customers and say ""NO SOUP FOR YOU"".  In this case it would be sushi of course.  A couple of my Nashville friends had been here before and told me that they ordered miso soup and got no soup because Sam told them they ""didn't need it"".  Also, another friend had asked for the remainder of his roll to go and Sam told him he wouldn't let him take it to go because it ""wouldn't be good"" later.  These encounters are what made me wonder what I could expect.

Our friend Josh got there ahead of us and told Sam that he was a regular which helps to smooth things out.  Unlike most restaurants that welcome new guests Sam's isn't one of those.  (Tip:  even if it is your first time act like you have been there before and follow my experience below to know what to do).

Sam himself is a portly Japanese man who is the owner and chef.  The sushi joint is tiny so this is why he is in full charge.  The drill is that you get your menu, write down which rolls you want and take them up to the counter for Sam.  I wrote down my rolls and made a note that I didn't want cucumber.  My friend hissed at me, ""Heather, just take the cucumber out, we don't want to upset him"" but being the fact that I am a defiant and stubborn person I said, ""No, I don't want the roll made with cucumber and I'm going to tell him"".   To their horror I turned in my order as such but surprisingly Sam was nice about it.  He even told me that my 2nd roll that I ordered would have cucumber so did I want him to take it out too?  Phew, we passed that.

The only issue came later:  Sam put our trays of sushi up on the sushi counter and I swear I heard a bell ding so we all got up and approached the bar to get the order only to be yelled at, his arms flailing in the air because it wasn't ready yet, he wasn't ""finished with it"" and as he snatched the sushi trays back down we practically ran back to our seats.  A few minutes later he came out from behind the counter and brought us the food, cheerfully.  

You are probably wondering if the sushi is good?  It is good, not great, but good.  The best part is the price because you get two huge rolls for $5.00 during lunch and this will more than fill you up.  Go here for the price and to experience the rules and procedures of Sam.  Just be aware of all the little written signs in the place, such as ""No Tipping"" allowed (Sam hates tips) and also the sign on the napkin dispensers that say ""Don't Waste"".  As long as you can follow the rules you will have a great experience (final tip: read other Yelp reviews of this place to hear more Sam stories to be fully prepared).

Here's to sushi struggle!!",1,"good"
"3","The Best Sushi at the Best prices in the USA. This is like Chicago's famous Jimmy's Red Hots. Very Very Generous portions of good quality authentic food and very very generous prices.  Sam is a great guy, when he remembers you. But he is also a grouch. He is very touchy on alot of things, and HE DOES NOT WANT new customers. SO if you have never been there then please follow the following procedure to avoid getting on his nerves and getting yourself kicked out, ive seen him do it several times and even had me lock the door so nobody else could enter. So FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE.

WALK IN, dont slam the door in, no cellphone talking, no ruckus.. Just quietly and civilized walk in. Head straight to the bar which behind he stands. Avoid bumping into anything in the very small interior. Once at the bar, glance at the menu list which is on the wall, pick up the order pad and fill out EXACTLY.

any drinks or beer you got out of the fridge (DONT ASK WHAT HES GOT TO DRINK, look at the smal fridge, they offer SAPPORO beer at good price, try it)

Once you have written everything down, then just place it ontop of the bar and have a seat,  When you come in dont come in all happy jolly wanting to interview the man and dont start asking him if he knows the whereabouts of the karate kid actor etc.  He will ask you if you have been there before (like secret bordellos do) and you want to say YES, many times! and you always ask me the same thing, HAHAHA.. Ok stop the fake laugh and just ask him what he thinks about the presidential elections.. and you will have a fine dinning experience. I know the procedure sounds like WTF.. but trust me.. just follow it, especially if you take a date, it will keep you from emberassing yourself.. You will Look COOL and HIP since sam will usually chew out most customers and treats you like a shinobi homie. for under 5 bucks you get 2 FAT rolls.. if we were to compare this joint to most sushi places.. lets say your getting a cuban cigar compared to the typical virginia slims (for those of you who dont smoke, lil teeny skinny sissy cigaretes)  and also comes with a lil veggie salad. This alone will fill you up, for under 5 bucks, you can even share with your girl if she eats like bambi, both of you can eat for under 5 bucks. After you finish eating just leave the plate, make no attempt to pick anything up and DONT LEAVE a tip.. trust me he dont need your stinking greenbacks... His Yen gives our dollars wedgies.. thanks bush..

But seriously, I have ate many sushi all over the country.. and this is by far the best damn sushi ive had in my life.. The price is uncanny and the quality of the food and portion is just phenomenal.. 
This place can be easily missed, so look for the sign on the window, next to the printers alley big ol red street sign.
