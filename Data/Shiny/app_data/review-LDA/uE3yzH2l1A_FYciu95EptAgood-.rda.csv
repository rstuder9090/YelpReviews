"2","In a word: consistent. Every time. Consistently busy. Consistently limited service. Consistently good. Consistently slow due to limited staffing. Consistently good. Did I say it's good? I've been coming here for years and it's ALWAYS good. And always slow. It's worth the patience of being there to enjoy a wonderful meal. Your mileage may vary depending upon your level of patience.

Have you noticed Stranger Things III has some really good tracks...but I may have been drinking as I downed my Pad Kee Mao leftovers? Yes, there's enough for (at least) two meals in every entree. Or maybe I'm just not the glutton I used to be (I'll go with the former.)

Full wok. Full pad. Full sushi. Full bar...and noodles and fushies and spices. Oh, my! It may be Thai Fusion heaven but, it's likely just a darned good restaurant. My dining companions come for curries, but I'm in one of Bill and Ted's excellent ruts with two chopsticks up for a Lychee martini and Pad Kee Mao (a.k.a. Drunken Noodle) at level 4 heat with the spice condiment tray on the side. The added anise-chili paste is {insert fave over-the-top exclamatory remark here}!

Get your prayer beads out for me as I contemplate telling the kitchen to just sock it to me like their great grandparents made it. The kitchen will be in an uproar to discover whether or not gGran actually passed the old recipe to anyone. It may be homestyle spice on a damned Yankee southerner for my next visit (though I have a feeling I'll actually need to travel to Thailand's Bo.Lan for the unmitigated heat...unless Koi sees this and puts my palette in its place. O.M.G.)",1,"good"

They have two locations - East Nashville and this one in Franklin off Columbia Ave.

We walked in around 12:30 and they weren't busy at all. Sometimes an empty restaurant worries me, but I trusted my friend on this one. We were directed to seat ourselves and chose a comfortable booth. I found it kind of funny they play jazz music, but it makes for a great background to conversation. 

They offer an extensive menu selection ranging from sushi, bento boxes (teriyaki), noodles, stir fry's, and curries. I opted for spicy eggplant which came with white rice, a vegetable spring roll, and my choice of salad over miso soup. Everything was tasty and far from ordinary. My salad's ginger dressing was one of a kind, their spring roll refreshing and the array of veggies that came mixed with my eggplant was so vast, I didn't even know what one of my veggies was.

If I had to give one critique, it's that my dish was labeled spicy but had no kick at all (I don't particularly have a high tolerance either) and I wish my meal was more eggplant forward rather than a few pieces mixed in with the rest of the veggies. I, really, love eggplant. I probably won't order that specific dish again and would gladly try other items. I tried a bite of my friend's red curry and that too was yummy, but again, no spice! I'm going to ask them to fire it up next time!

While this isn't a destination restaurant, the fact that it's within 10ish minutes from me makes it totally worthwhile and a place I can see incorporating in my ""regular"" rotation.",2,"good"
