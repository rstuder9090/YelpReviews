"2","We met some friends here the other night for dinner. At Tsunami, guests have the option of being sat in a booth or at the large teppanyaki tables for dinner and a show. There is no price difference. We opted for the show. 

It was Friday around 730pm and we waited about half an hour. For those not in the know, Tsunami will not sit guests at the teppanyaki tables until there are 10 people to be seated. 

Our server (aka drink taker) had a trainee and seemed sort of on-guard and frazzled. My husband ordered a 2-4-1 vodka and pineapple and she kept pushing the more expensive vokda on him when he kept saying well. Very annoying. I ordered  a sake cocktail with pear that was delicious and packed a punch. 

All the meals at Tsunami come with a clear broth soup (delicious and light with mushrooms, scallions, and fried onions), a ginger salad (ok,not great), fried rice (yummy), fried noodles (delicious), 2 shrimp (an odd appetizer but very tasty), and veggies. For my protein I had steak and scallops for $26 and they were delicious. You get a decent amount of scallops for the higher price tag, which was good. My steak was cooked the way I asked and everything was seasoned well. the two sauces, a white sauce and a brown, tangy sauce, both complemented the food. 

Our chef was very talented and very engaging. He did a good job with all the tricks and added a few I've never seen at other, similar restaurants. 

This is definitely a celebration place and not really good for a casual dinner. Due to the noise, we had a hard time talking to our friends. The higher price tag will also deter us from coming often but next time we have a large group for a birthday or graduation, this would be a great place to come.",1,"good"
"3","Hibachi is super fun to watch, eat and enjoy overall! This place is no exception. It's great for parties, date nights, special events or just a good meal. This location has ample parking and is near shopping centers and stores. 

I would recommend reservations for groups to ensure seating and accommodations at the grill top tables. They have table service where they do not cook in front of you but these are 2 and 4 person tables mainly from what I observed. This is also the option we opted for when we dined in this time. 

The table wasn't as clean as we would have preferred and the menu was sticky but other than that, the rest of our experience was wonderful. 

We ordered the steak and shrimp entree. It started with soup and salad which was perfect to hold us until the main entree. The soup has mushrooms (watch out if you have allergies!) and I added some soy sauce for an extra kick! The salad has a wonderful ginger dressing and was just the perfect amount. Next comes the noodles! These were a nice touch as I haven't been to another hibachi style restaurant that does this. 

Then the main event, steak and shrimp. The steak was cooked medium however we ordered medium rare. It did not lack flavor and was very tender so we did not mind at all. The shrimp were wonderful! It came with rice and veggies as potatoes were in the mix as well. 

Overall, this was a great meal and so much food! Come prepared to bring home leftovers unless you are super hungry and then you can tackle this meal full force!!",2,"good"
"4","I'm really torn about this review as our first encounter with Tsunami didn't set a great tone for our visit. A friend from out of town was visiting and his husband selected the restaurant based on some local friends.

When they called for a reservation for last night they were told they only took reservations for the Hibachi tables, which was fine. They were then told 'don't be late"", 'everyone has to be there to be seated"" and 'we'll only hold your reservation for 15 minutes'. OK, it's a Saturday night I get that, but they made it sound like they were scolding us before we ever got to the restaurant.

Needless to say, we made sure to arrive WELL before our 7:00 reservation (about 6:50), parking right around the restaurant is pretty limited based on the number of seats, one of us found parking in the Starbuck's lot next door and the other in Home Depot lot behind the restaurant. 

We checked in and the waiting area was already packed, when your Teppanyaki tables sit 10-12 people and you are turning multiple tables at the same time there needs to be SOMEPLACE for people to stand. People were crawling over each other to get to any open benches, to the bathroom or out of the restaurant.

Needless to say, 7:00 came and went and we weren't seated, it was just about 7:12 when they call us for our table. Our party of four was seated of a family of three and two parents with an extremely well behaved toddler.

I think in a rush to turn hibachi tables they didn't do a great job of wiping things down; the counter was kind of greasy and menus the same way.

We all sat for quite a while before anyone came near our table; finally, server came out and took a drink order. After the drinks arrived our server took dinner orders and there was another long wait before the soup and salad came out right behind each other.

When eating in a Japanese restaurant I typically order tea because, most times, you get a pot with pretty decent tea. Usually, it's loose leaf tea, you let it steep and there's enough to refill several times. I was pretty disappointed when our server showed up with an Ikea mug with pre-brewed tea. To her credit she did ask if I wanted another cup.

The soup was a really light, not very flavorful broth, with a few slices of button mushroom and green onion. OK, but not very flavorful. The salad was chopped iceberg lettuce with a little shredded carrot. The salads were really well chilled and the ginger dressing had a lot of flavor.

Our friends had ordered Sesame Chicken ($4.75) as an appetizer; we were nearly done both our soup and salads when the appetizer arrived, it was cubes of diced chicken breast in a sweet teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds. It was dumped in a pile in the middle of a square, white plate, it looked like it would if the hibachi chef was putting it on your plate off the griddle... no garnish, nothing. Just really odd.
At this point the hibachi chef had still not come out; we sat again waiting. When he arrived, he wasn't really warm or engaging, but he warmed up and ended up being pretty entertaining. He was really sweet with the toddler too.

He started his show with spinning his fork and spatula, played with an egg got some rice, vegetables and shrimp appetizer started he did an onion volcano and played train with the little girl.

Our table had a nice mix of entrees, our friends Seared Tuna was 6 ounces ($28.00) and seared beautifully and really flavorful. Our other friends Sirloin Steak ($19.00) was an 8-ounce portion of Angus beef, was cooked perfectly, was tender and flavorful.

My husband and I both had the Hibachi Chicken ($17.00), it was a good size portion (8 ounces), great flavor but a little overcooked. The shrimp appetizer was nice with the dipping sauce, the vegetables, and noodles were nicely seasoned, and big portions. I found the fried rice to pretty bland, boring and just steamed rice with scrambled egg and some sauce.

All-in-all I wasn't really impressed, the service was just OK, as was the food. They really seem to be packing people in with 11 tables; it just seemed too cattle call for my liking.

Don't think we'll be heading back any time soon.",1,"bad"
"5","I was eager to try this restaurant as many people have given good reviews. To my disappointment our first visit was plagued by poor customer service throughout the meal. With a party of 11 we filled an entire table. We arrived promptly at 8:25 for our 8:30 reservation and happily waited for a table. Despite not being seated come 9:00p.m. We abided by their policy of needing our entire party (of which 3 remained) before being seated. Shortly after our entire party was present and yet we had not been seated by 9:20. It should be noted that while waiting there were other individuals openly complaining and we had the great displeasure of witnessing the hostesses bad-mouthing their customers just outside the door -- I guess they thought no other customers could see them directly behind the podium. When asking for a manager due to the delay we were told that she was busy and would be up when she could. This wouldn't happen until another 10 minutes went by. The manager, Brittany's, first response to the situation was that technically they only had to hold our reservation for 15 minutes and since our entire party had not arrived until 9:00 (despite the fact that the hostesses openly admitted they did not have a table ready for us regardless). At the table, and still unsatisfied with the staff and managers' poor approach to the situation I again asked for a manager. This time I spoke with Gary. I relayed the entire situation to him and yet did not receive the slightest empathy. He merely dryly replied ""I am sorry"" and that was it. As a previous assistant manager I was horrified to see this lackluster performance in customer service. Managers should always be empathetic, understanding, and work with their staff and customers best they know how to ease customer issues as best possible. It is a shame that our first experience had to be so poor. I will never return to this location.",2,"bad"
