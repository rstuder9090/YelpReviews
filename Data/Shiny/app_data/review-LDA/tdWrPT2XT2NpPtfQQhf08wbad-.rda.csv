"2","We came here on a Thursday night for the all-you-can-eat sushi. Some of the other reviews on Yelp were a bit worrying, but everything was very good, especially considering the very reasonable price, and we'll definitely be back.

The AYCE sushi is made-to-order rather than a buffet, and the menu includes sashimi, nigiri, regular rolls, and fancy rolls. There's also a kitchen menu - we ordered only miso soup, but there were other items available as well.

The standard rolls and nigiri are exactly what you'd expect. One highlight was the mango and avocado roll, which turned out to be one of my favorite items that night.

The specialty rolls were good. Not great, but solidly good and very satisfying, well-balanced, and not too heavy on rice. One note - not all of the specialty rolls on the restaurant menu are available for AYCE. The AYCE rolls seem to be mainly limited to those filled with spicy tuna/salmon/etc. or tempura. But they're often topped with real slabs of fish, so I can't complain.

The sashimi, as other reviewers have said, really is cut super thin, but it was still quality fish. So it wasn't bad, really, just sort of silly.

So while this place is nowhere near as amazing as Blue Fin, it's still a good meal at half the price, and you don't need a reservation weeks in advance.",1,"good"
"3","Very very solid experience every time. I fancy their sushi rolls but the fancier ones. their hand rolls are delicious. The hand rolled spider roll is my favorite along with the hand rolled oyster roll. The pink lady is another favorite in our household. I don't think I've ever had anything other than their Japanese cuisine but the place is usually packed and everybody seems happy. The miso soup is to die for. I know that sounds strange because it's such a basic thing but I could literally eat that stuff by the quart and I order a quart every time I'm there.

So if you want some good food for a decent price go see my friends at Jasmine Asian House and oh yeah tell 'em big Texas sent you.",2,"good"
"4","We live so close and it is super convenient to order from here. Their pineapple curry rice is delicious, sadly it's inconsistently made. We love it in our house however, we have an allergy and when it is made different every other time it forces us to not order it. We tend to cave and order it on occasion, we now have to request certain vegetables be left out of it since the ingredients change. We repeat the request three times minimum and ask that the order gets repeated, our request is never repeated back. Our order is large and to dig to the bottom of our bag to double check is not ideal so I asked the gentleman what the usual ingredients are and he says all the Ingredients we are used to having in the rice so I trusted that everything is good. Get home and nope the order is wrong, I call back to let them know, they did replace it and I checked at the restaurant this time. However when we went to eat it they decided to add some other random vegetables that aren't usually included and the flavor was off completely. We love ordering from here but be aware that special requests are not followed and the recipes change, if you have allergies and dietary restrictions I wouldn't order/eat from here.

We just gave it another go and disappointed again, we will NOT be ordering from here again. 90% onions and peppers 10% beef this is what you get when you order the Mongolian Beef.",1,"bad"
"5","I went there on a Thursday evening at 7:30pm. the place was dead, 1 other table occupied by 2 women, that was it the whole time I was there. Maybe I should have taken that as a clue? 
I got the AYCE dinner, it was not worth $21 for sure!
 I started with the calamari and a couple cheese wontons. The calamari resembled onion rings and was nothing near fresh, possibly the worst i have ever had! The cheese wontons were ok, not great just ok. 
Then I ordered my sushi and sashimi. 
I ordered some red snapper, white tuna and salmon from the sashimi menu. The white tuna was by far the best of them and was fresh. The salmon and red snapper was decent, not the freshest sashimi I have eaten but not bad. 
For the sushi rolls I got a Philadelphia roll (they forgot to put the avocado in it), spicy tuna roll (not very good, kinda flavorless) and a mango & avocado roll (absolutely horrible, mango was old and dried).
I tried a piece of the spicy tuna pizza (specialty sushi piece) and it was lacking flavor as well.
I stopped there and said that I was finished, I was full but very disappointed in my meal. 
I will not return to this place since there are so many sushi places around here it's just not worth wasting the money for another meal that will disappoint. 
The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the sashimi was decent, other wise it would have been 1 star. honestly everything else was not so good and the server was very unattenative .",2,"bad"
