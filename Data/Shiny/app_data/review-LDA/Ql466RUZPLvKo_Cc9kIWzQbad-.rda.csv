"2","This is the place you want to go for solid sushi at cheap prices.  It's not cheap food, it's good food for cheap prices.  We were one of two couples on a Friday night so the ambiance is very low key.  Lots of people do lunch or take-out.  My wife is a fan of that.  We split 4 rolls, and 2 apps for $57 w/ tip, and brought a bottle of wine (obviously BYOB).  Would definitely go back when we have a sushi craving and want to not have a big night out.  Small parties of no more than 6-8 by the looks of it.  Nice service.  I saw other reviews that were critical, but you can't go in here with the expectation you're getting gourmet sushi.  It's good sushi that doesn't break the bank.  Feel like I said that theme enough.",1,"good"
"3","We love this place!!! Extremely kid friendly- my son loves the spring rolls and rice. We love the sushi  especially for the price. My mother gets the beef with vegetables and you get a lot of beef AND vegetables.  It's byob but have hot sake and beer for 3$ you can't beat that.  They have a new roll with white tuna that is yummy. We usually get the same rolls over and over such as Tiffany maki, red dragon , Godzilla,volcano and of course crunchy spicy tuna or salmon ALL always good. Sometimes you have to stay on top of them for service but they try super hard and are very friendly.",2,"good"
"4","We are new to the neighborhood and found ourselves looking for a quick dinner out in the neighborhood and this seemed to be the best option with no wait (I quickly realized why there wasn't a line out the door).  The service was just about the worst I've ever experienced - the whole dinner took 2 hours and they brought 2 out of 3 soups maybe 15 minutes after ordering with the 3rd coming out about 20 minutes later to start the meal.  We had to ask for water...and silverware...and napkins.  They seemed very busy with take out, but there were only 3 tables of people in the restaurant.  The sushi that I had wasn't bad, but my husband had an upset stomach all night from the moo shoo pork.",1,"bad"
"5","We saw the reviews and decided to try this place out, since it was close. The decor of the restaurant is decent. The service was ok, nothing great but satisfactory. We ordered several items including a seaweed soup, speciality roll, sashimi, and a more basic roll. The soup was ok, lacked flavor but not too bad. The sashimi was decent, tasted like it had been sitting for a while. The sushi was not good -- tasted old and was actually somewhat dark in color. The other roll was actually difficult to eat -- it tasted stale and old. The menu said ""tempura"" style, but what we actually got was a fried piece of I don't know. 

I travel regularly on business and have experienced some excellent sushi in Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, and even here in Philly there are some excellent spots in neighboring Chestnut Hill and even a 1/2 way decent buffet on the other side of 476 in Plymouth meeting. This sushi lacked freshness and flavor -- two important qualities that make sushi so great.",2,"bad"
