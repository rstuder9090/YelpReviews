"2","Extremely excellent meal! We sort of pigged out here, but the food was so good we couldn't help it.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings and edamame as appetizers. Both came out piping hot and tasted delicious. For our main dishes, I ordered the pineapple shrimp. Usually neither are my forte, especially together, but the picture on the menu looked too good to pass up. When the pineapple shrimp arrived at our table I was disappointed to find out it looked nothing like the picture. It was very good though and restored my faith in the restaurant. My husband ordered the udon soup noodles and it was just amazing( I kept stealing bites of his food lol). 

Aside from the presentation being misleading the other (minor) reasons this review is a 4 instead of a 5 are as follows. 
1. The waitress the entire meal hovered over us whenever we spoke to her( she was in my personal space and it was uncomfortable) 
2. On a Saturday night, with a half empty restaurant, the hostess gave us trouble about getting seated. 
3. After our meal, the hostess asked me if I was picking up a delivery order( very strange considering I just spent the last hour in your restaurant at a table near the hostess stand) 
4. The tiniest reason of all.... from our table I could see pictures. In the one picture frame, they kept the pictures in the frame from when they bought it. The one photo clearly has a label saying it fits photo prints of 4X6. As someone who frames a lot of photos at home, this photo frame was bought at the dollar store- lol

In any event, we can't wait to come back!",1,"good"
"3","This place for the Location is frigging awesome. Don't have to travel to the city to Mori's and waste time parking.  The quality of sushi is superb. The owner hand picks it and you can tell the difference. I have to say his Salmon is so buttery and good it's hard to duplicate. The Yellow Tail Jalape√±o is in a League of Its Own.!!!  Wasabi Roll +, Avocado Salad ++++,Salmon Sashimi Roll just to get a few good ones rolling..

Oh. Like Bob said, you may wait a bit on the weekends because they get crowded, because everyone enjoys it!!!   except Bob M. From Mahwah, because he's a chronic complainer and pompous ass...

Hey Bob. Bring someone fun with you and the time flys bye waiting for the sushi...or just sit there and throw a fit and annoy everyone around you...114 raving reviews and you're the one dope.",2,"good"
"4","It pains me to write this review. I first ate here a year ago on business. I came back two more times during that trip because it was so good. Excited to be the area again I went for dinner.  I bought an app and specialty roll. The app came out burnt and you could tell they were hesitant to serve it. Unfortunately they did, the shrimp was tough and the coconut was burnt. I ate one and tried to remove the coating on a second. I pushed it away because I was watching roll, prepared, waiting at the bar the whole time. It was warm by the time it was served. At this point she asked if the app was burnt. I said yes and said I did not want anymore. The sushi was ok, but I have had a lot better. When the bill came I was charged for the burnt app that I sent back. I paid the tab, but had to share the experience. I hope next time I can rate it a 4 again.",1,"bad"
"5","I rarely give such bad ratings to local establishments, but this was just such a fail in so many ways. First of all, I want to say.. shame on you Yelpers who came her and lied about this place. We went with such high hopes, depending on Yelp to guide us to a place that would satisfy our Japanese food craving, especially since we are new to the area.

Shame on you! (Especially the guy who said Tako has the ""best sushi on the entire planet."" That's insulting to literally every other Japanese restaurant on the planet.)

This was our experience at Tako:

We originally went because we wanted soba noodles, but they do NOT have that here. This is probably the first Japanese restaurant that we've been to that didn't have the staple dish on their menu, but we brushed if off and ordered other things (1 ""Dinner Box A"" and 2 ""special"" rolls).

1. Everything was overpriced, for what was being served. Just one quick skimming of the menu, and you can tell there isn't really anything spectacular, but the prices suggest that there may be. We're from New York and I've grown up eating at countless restaurants all over the city since I was a child, so when I say something is overpriced, I'm not joking. BUT we were hungry and didn't want to bother looking for another place to eat, so we decided to just give it a shot.

2. The wait for the food was absolutely ridiculous. We went hungry, then sat there as the sushi ""chefs"" took their time, moving slower than I've ever seen any chefs move, and looking like they had no care in the world, whether their customers were going hungry or not. I think it took about 30-45 minutes for us to actually get our food, once we ordered. We kept glancing over at the chefs to hint that we'd really like to eat soon, but it didn't seem to bother them at all. Maybe they take extra long so that you're starving by the time you get your food and just scarf it down without worrying about the taste.

3. The serving sizes for the prices are just stupid. If the quality of the fish was outstanding, I wouldn't even have minded. It wasn't. The raw salmon inside the roll should have been a bright orange, but it was more like a dull orange, almost pastel-colored. The dinner box was $25, but it had more of a variety of foods and was the most reasonably-priced thing we ordered.

4. The taste profiles were just.. off. I am not an food expert, and I won't pretend to be some sort of professional taste tester. But I've had GOOD Japanese food many times in my life, and the flavors were just not right. First of all, the miso soup that we were given at the beginning of the meal was overly salty and tasted like MSG. I don't use any MSG in any of my food, so I'm fairly sensitive to it, and even the hubs said off the bat that the soup was packed with MSG. Secondly, the rolls were just odd. The sauces were weird, there was asparagus in a roll that overpowered the rest of the flavors, and there was one roll that was fried for so long that the entire roll was hot and the rice inside was like porridge. Just.. no.

5. Everything so far already told me and the hubs that we would never return to this establishment, ever again. But the kicker? One of the servers actually pulled up a tub of water with bubbling cleaning solution in it and started washing a rag in it, RIGHT ON THE SUSHI BAR. There were two plates ready to be served, waiting to be taken to the customers, on top of the, and just under it (where the plates and utensils are set for customers to EAT) was the splashing tub of cleaning solution. I get that it's important to keep a restaurant clean, but who wants to risk having drops of whatever was in that tub mixed into their dish, especially since she couldn't even rinse said rag without thick rubber gloves on?

If you like bad sushi, a terribly long wait time and don't mind having some windex or bleach splashed onto your food, Tako is the place for you. We'll be searching for another Japanese spot instead.",2,"bad"
