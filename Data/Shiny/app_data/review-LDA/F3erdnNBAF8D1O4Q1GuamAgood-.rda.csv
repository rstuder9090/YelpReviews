"2","We have avoided this place like the plague because people said it was bad.  Well they were all wrong, it was great.  We went in on Saturday for dinner because it was on the way home.  There is nothing special about the d√©cor, but you cant eat that so I don't care.  The first pleasant surprise was the one man band in the corner.  I know what you are thinking loud and obnoxious (I was thinking the same thing) but it was a young girl that sang very soothing music that fit the mood my family was looking for.  The second surprise is an kids menu that fits the generic American child's food pallet, both my kids got chicken nuggets.  

FOOD:
Crab Salad - Going into to this I thought it would be like Wasabi's crab salad, but I was wrong again.  It was a sweet vinegar dressing that was very refreshing.  It was a great way to cleans and prep the pallet before the other items.
Crab Rangoon's - Some of the best in town.  They were very light and fluffy and filled with crab.  You heard me correctly it was filled with crab!  It was probably around that 40% crab instead of your usual 5-10% crab.  My daughter even loved them because they had an actual crab flavor.
Sushi - Sunburn Roll - This is a simple and inexpensive roll with lots of flavor.   It is a California roll with spicy sauce on top and backed under the broiler I think.  It had a slightly smocked flavor that was enjoyable.
Sushi - Nitro - This is a big roll so you better have a big mouth.  It is a spicy tuna roll topped with avocado, tuna, crab, crunch, bonito, shredded nori & spicy mayo.  This roll was refreshing and surprisingly light.  The waitress suggested both rolls and she was right on the money.

So if you are looking for a new sushi place over by the lake you should try this place, we will be going back.",1,"good"
"3","My buddy lives near Geist and we both love sushi.. With that being said, I am very picky about where I go to eat it. We meet for lunch about once month at our norm, One World Market near castleton which I think is the best!! We decided to try something nearby and consulted yelp. Red Sake Asian Fusion popped up only 2 minutes away. Wow, I'm impressed! Nice quaint little restaurant tucked away in a little strip mall... Lunch special!! Take a look at the picture, this is what you get for around $60 at lunchtime... Simple sushi that is made fresh. Can't beat it!! They do have nigiri, sashimi, etc... Awesome!! Now we don't have to fight the traffic and hassle of the castleton area !!",2,"good"
