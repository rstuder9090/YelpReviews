"2","I came to Sushi Teri because of the great reviews I've seen online. I literally arrived less than 3 hours after stepping off the plane and it did not disappoint.

Being by myself I just sat down at the sushi bar and simply asked the sushi chef for recommendations. He highly recommended the halibut and yellow tuna that evening so I started with 2 pieces of Nigiri with the Halibut. It was so incredibly good and I wish I could remember the name of the sauce he drizzled on it. It was just divine.

I then asked for a recommendation on a roll with tuna and / or salmon and he high recommended the Crunchy Roll. Salmon, Tuna, Cream Cheese, rice and then dropped into a fryer. Sliced and served with a nice stacked presentation.

The salmon looked so amazing in the glass, I decided to finish off with 2 more pieces of Nigiri with the Salmon. Again, excellent. As I sat there I watched the chefs prepare multiple rolls and each looked awesome. The entire meal was much more reasonable than I expected. 

Highly highly recommend Sushi Teri if you're in the area. There's parking on the street and there's actually a fairly large public parking lot behind the restaurant as well. The entrance to the parking lot is a few doors past Sushi Teri on Linden Avenue on the left.",1,"good"
"3","Will you be having the best sushi of your life here?  Probably not.  But, will you undoubtedly have a good time?  Hell yes!
Recently renovated, Sushi Teri boasts a large dining room, several booths, sushi bar, and beverage bar.  The staff there is extremely accommodating and the service is speedy.
I've been here several times, the last trip being the best by far.  I've had date nights here, and as enjoyable as they may be, the sushi itself lacked the excitement necessary to spice up a date night.  However, my last dining experience here was with a large group of friends.  We ordered some simple rolls and a few sake bombs.  We invited the chef to have a drink with us, thinking there was no way he'd join.  A few rolls and several sake bombs in, the chef traipsed out of the kitchen to partake.  Too bad we had just finished all of our alcohol :-(
Point being, the ambience and staff provide for an excellent time.  As we delved deeper into drunkenness, we became more adventurous in our sushi choices.  The specialty rolls, albeit a smaller selection than hoped for, are delicious!  Fittingly, don't leave without trying the Carpinteria roll! Yum.",2,"good"
