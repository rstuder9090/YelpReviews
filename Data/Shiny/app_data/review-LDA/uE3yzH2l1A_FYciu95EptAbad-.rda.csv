"2","In a word: consistent. Every time. Consistently busy. Consistently limited service. Consistently good. Consistently slow due to limited staffing. Consistently good. Did I say it's good? I've been coming here for years and it's ALWAYS good. And always slow. It's worth the patience of being there to enjoy a wonderful meal. Your mileage may vary depending upon your level of patience.

Have you noticed Stranger Things III has some really good tracks...but I may have been drinking as I downed my Pad Kee Mao leftovers? Yes, there's enough for (at least) two meals in every entree. Or maybe I'm just not the glutton I used to be (I'll go with the former.)

Full wok. Full pad. Full sushi. Full bar...and noodles and fushies and spices. Oh, my! It may be Thai Fusion heaven but, it's likely just a darned good restaurant. My dining companions come for curries, but I'm in one of Bill and Ted's excellent ruts with two chopsticks up for a Lychee martini and Pad Kee Mao (a.k.a. Drunken Noodle) at level 4 heat with the spice condiment tray on the side. The added anise-chili paste is {insert fave over-the-top exclamatory remark here}!

Get your prayer beads out for me as I contemplate telling the kitchen to just sock it to me like their great grandparents made it. The kitchen will be in an uproar to discover whether or not gGran actually passed the old recipe to anyone. It may be homestyle spice on a damned Yankee southerner for my next visit (though I have a feeling I'll actually need to travel to Thailand's Bo.Lan for the unmitigated heat...unless Koi sees this and puts my palette in its place. O.M.G.)",1,"good"
"3","Friends of mine who have similar foodie tastes as me kept raving about Koi. I finally got around to going for lunch today and I'm really happy about it!

They have two locations - East Nashville and this one in Franklin off Columbia Ave.

We walked in around 12:30 and they weren't busy at all. Sometimes an empty restaurant worries me, but I trusted my friend on this one. We were directed to seat ourselves and chose a comfortable booth. I found it kind of funny they play jazz music, but it makes for a great background to conversation. 

They offer an extensive menu selection ranging from sushi, bento boxes (teriyaki), noodles, stir fry's, and curries. I opted for spicy eggplant which came with white rice, a vegetable spring roll, and my choice of salad over miso soup. Everything was tasty and far from ordinary. My salad's ginger dressing was one of a kind, their spring roll refreshing and the array of veggies that came mixed with my eggplant was so vast, I didn't even know what one of my veggies was.

If I had to give one critique, it's that my dish was labeled spicy but had no kick at all (I don't particularly have a high tolerance either) and I wish my meal was more eggplant forward rather than a few pieces mixed in with the rest of the veggies. I, really, love eggplant. I probably won't order that specific dish again and would gladly try other items. I tried a bite of my friend's red curry and that too was yummy, but again, no spice! I'm going to ask them to fire it up next time!

While this isn't a destination restaurant, the fact that it's within 10ish minutes from me makes it totally worthwhile and a place I can see incorporating in my ""regular"" rotation.",2,"good"
"4","So, heres the deal. I love their food. It's fresh, it's tasty, and there is a really good selection. The price point is also very fair. Here are my issues with them that have made me quit eating there. First, their service is really slow. Even when the restaurant is almost empty be prepared to wait. Don't go with the understanding that you will be in and out, or that you will ever get your water refilled. It probably won't happen. The kicker for me that has stopped my patronage is an issue with payment. I met a friend the other day for lunch, and it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to bring my card back so we could do. Their internet was acting up, they said. I checked my bank account the next day (Saturday) and saw they had charged me for my meal three separate times. Now, the charges were still pending, but my bank sees pending charges as money that's already gone, so I didn't have access to it. I went to the restaurant, and spoke to the manager. He blew me off, saying it's just pending, the bank won't charge you. Don't worry about it. I had the receipt, and showed him my online banking form so he could see that yes, I was charged three times. Today is Wednesday, and the charges finally left pending status, and I was charged twice. Back to Koi I went, and spoke to the manager again. He said that he saw the batch, had already called the bank, and I would have my money back in my account on Monday. Monday! I was really irritated, because he wasn't taking this seriously. When I mentioned how long this has been and issue, and Monday wasn't going to work for me, he just shrugged, and repeated that my money will be back Monday. Even when I said that I would prefer a cash refund so I could run down to the bank and have it by tomorrow, he kept repeating I would have it Monday. So, I will have been short on my account for a week and a half, and nothing done to make that better. We don't have a bunch of money to throw around, and I had budgeted this amount to meet a friend. So, if you're going to eat there, don't expect good service, and pay in cash.",1,"bad"
"5","I do NOT recommend this restaurant.  Ordered 2 lunch orders - both were priced pretty high but considering what they came with I was ok with it.

The Shrimp bento had 4 pieces of shrimp, 3 mushrooms pieces, onions and a lot of sauce and rice.  The gyoza was 3 pieces.  That's it.  They told the driver that they don't have salad or soup. So I paid $17 bucks for basically a bowl of 80 cent rice.  I buy shrimp in the market all the time and I know it's not THAT expensive and a restaurant should get better pricing than a grocery store.  

The Chicken dish had more protein but nothing but protein, sauce and rice.  Came with 1 small eggroll and, again, the advertised soup was left out since ""they don't have soup"" for lunch orders. 

To top it off - very bland.  it's basically suger and water with very little seasoning.    So sad that I wasted so much money on this restaurant.",2,"bad"
