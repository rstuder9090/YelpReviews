"2","I had been trying to find a place to park so that I could try J Sushi and finally found one today in front of Jeff. A Sunday, around 4:30 the place was mine and the server gave me all her attention. The place is Quaker plain in its decor. But I appreciated the calm gray reserve and black tables. Restful. Having perused the menu online several times I knew I wanted the fried oysters $7). Just the idea was too good to pass up. I prefer Sashimi to Sushi. I want to savor the fish and not the surroundings.The server suggested the baby yellow fin special ($17, a little pricey) and I agreed.
The oysters arrived nicely garnished. The taste and the texture climb to the ethers. Just a perfect dish.  The baby yellow fin appeared on a lovely wide dish garnished with radish, cucumber, yellow caviar and tiny dice-like cubes of dragon fruit. Here too, a delight (although a bit expensive, at least for me.) 
J Sushi was everything that I've read on other Yelp posts. If you can find a place to park, this is a cannot miss.",1,"good"

I have no complaints about J Sushi.  It can get a little pricey but nothing we did not expect when deciding to eat here.  If I remember correctly there might have been a discount if you paid with cash (???) but I already knew I was paying with credit so I did not pay attention well enough.  

As always we decided to share everything so that meant we ordered more than we needed to, but it was delicious all the same.  We started with the Kani Salad (Spicy crabmeat, cucumber, crunchy, masago) and it was a perfect amount for two to share since other entrees were coming.  Very fresh ingredients and a great starter.  For our main courses we got the Sashimi Deluxe (18 pcs assorted raw fish and served with miso soup or green salad) and the Pick 3 Special Rolls.  The rolls we ordered were:

-American Dream: Eel, avocado, cream cheese topped with crunchy spicy tuna, in house special sauce
-Naruto Roll: Salmon, tuna, white fish, crab stick, avocado, masago wrapped in cucumber with house special sauce
-No. 1 Roll: Eel, crabmeat, cucumber topped with salmon, tuna, avocado in house special sauce

I would highly recommend any of these rolls, especially the Naruto Roll.  It is very different than any roll I have ever had since it was wrapped in cucumber.  It had its own special flare.

The server was very pleasant and the ambiance is on point.  Our bill was kind of pricy but we really didn't need three rolls to share especially because the Sashimi Deluxe also came with miso soup or salad.",2,"good"
