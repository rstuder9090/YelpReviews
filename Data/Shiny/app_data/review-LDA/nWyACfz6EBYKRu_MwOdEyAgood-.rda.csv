Think standard Chinese slightly elevated with a slightly more diverse menu. The price isnt steep and i wouldnt describe it as ""pricey"" but i keep ending up spending a decent amount more than i would if i got it from panda pavilion a min away in audubon. The chicken and broc, rock shrimp, wonton soup, lo mein all sit around 8/10. The walnut ""prawns"" are just big shrimp with candied walnuts, actually really good, but not what i expected for the price 6.8/10. I also got a rainbow roll..... not so great kinda meh but the gf really enjoyed the crunchy salmon roll so im undecided at this point on their sushi game. I dont want to say wegmans rainbow roll is better but....wegmans rainbow roll was better. Wasabi isnt burn your nose off either, i like burn your nose off heat. So a 6/10 on the sushi. Either way i look forward to trying more!",1,"good"
"3","This is my goto place at work.  I need to find a goto place at home this good!  Nice restaurant, free parking, good service and great food!  I go here at least once a week.  I don't do seafood, but I love the teriyaki here, both the steak and chicken.  What steals the show for me is their delicious Ginger dressing.  It's so good I asked for the recipe and was surprised that it is mostly fruits and veggies blended into a thick and delicious addition to any salad!  Also good is their house brewed ice tea, give it a shot and tell me you don't agree!  Finally...They have really nice bathrooms...I'm sure George Costanza would agree!  

Great place for lunch, the prices are amazing.  I believe there is a constant price war with other local Asian places, so you can get some amazing lunch specials here for under 10$. The staff is great, very nice, and the owner is quite knowledgeable about food\nutrition.
