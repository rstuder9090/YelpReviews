"2","Came to Florida for a business trip and being a sushi fan I wanted to try this place out. I came during late night happy hour and I felt like I walked into a lounge. The lights were dimmed and the music was bumpin'. Upon walking in the first I thing I see is the hostess desk and behind them a large bar with seating on three sides. I thought it was pretty neat. Anyways, the restaurant has different sections for seating; one for the regular menu, another section for hibachi, and then the other side for some more regular menus. Did I mention that late night happy hour is half off sushi, drinks and apps! 

FYI: If you're looking for a nice, quiet eat your food and go, place this isn't it. Beware that service may be slow but the food is on point!

I started the night with a tall glass of Sangria with a shot of Grand Marnier. I love GM in Sangrias!  If you haven't tried it yet, it is a MUST TRY DRINK! The bartender that night made it to perfection, not too fruity not too bland. I think I had about 3 or 4 before I ended the night.

For app we tried to spicy tuna volcano which was mmm mmm good the heat was mild and the sauce was oh soo yummy. I loved the slices of jalapenos, so if you're into spicy I suggest trying this.

For my main dish I had the volcano roll... this was not 8 pieces but like 10 or 12! The inside was California roll and on top was a bunch of crab meat and spicy mayo all over. 

Paying half the price was pretty much worth it. Next time I'm in Florida I'll be ordering this all over again.",1,"good"
"3","Best Sushi I've found in town!  We don't live anywhere near Hiro's, but we pass quite a few other Sushi places along the way to eat at Hiro's.  We haven't tried the Japanese Steak House side of the place so I can't comment on that yet, but the sushi is outstanding.

Our favorite items include:
- Seaweed Salad - It's pretty much like any other place's good seaweed salad, but I have to have it every time I go for Sushi.
- Beef Tataki - an interesting slightly spicy recipe of rare seared (almost raw) beef
- Hiros Roll - any roll named after the restaurant better be good and this one does not disappoint.  Slightly sweet, not spicy
- Tempura TNT Roll - Spicy tuna, some other good stuff, spicy sauces, and the whole roll is Tempura deep fried
- Sexy Roll - Can't remember what's in this one, but it's great - trust me!  This is also one of the milder rolls. 
- Lollipop Roll - very mild - a great roll to end on and get the spicy rolls off your pallete when you're finished)

I haven't tried the Volcano yet, but I saw one and it looked great!

You cannot go wrong with the more expensive rolls on the menu.  I'm not a cheapskate when it comes to Sushi, so we haven't bothered to try their California Rolls, Tampa Rolls, or other simple items.  We always go for the good stuff and we were not disappointed.

They're open really late, and after 10pm all the Sushi is half price!  If we could wait that long to go out, it would be an outstanding deal.",2,"good"
"4","Do NOT eat here!  Food is poor to average, way overpriced.  David our server was attentive and friendly, however, unable or unwilling to resolve our issues.  The owner Jeannie is the problem here as she refused to honor their advertised offers of 1/2 price apps and sushi that is clearly posted on the website and the bottom of the ticket printed from their own POS.  

When we asked Jeannie to adjust our bill to the advertised special, she blamed her son Diego and refused to adjust the check, she went off on me when said 4 people quit today and she wasn't supposed to be there anyway.  Jeannie lost it when we asked to speak to Diego indicating she can't get ahold of him.  

Hiros, You should revisit your business practices and honor your own specials.  Half price is stated on your website as well as the ticket printed from your POS. You do realize customers don't care about your personal problems or business shortcomings.  Your tactics of bait and switch are not only unethical but illegal.  If you cannot afford to honor your own specials don't run any or close the doors.  Jeannie you should be ashamed of how you speak to customers and employees, treat others as you wish to be treated!",1,"bad"
"5","Where do I even start? I guarantee this place will close its doors within 3 months or less which is sad because it used to be the place to be. For starters one of their AC units had a bucket under it that was only catching about hlf the water that was leaking from it so the floor was saturated. Then we placed our order which we were told they were out of asparagus so we had to change one of our rolls, no big deal. Our appetizer comes out, vegetable tempura, it was practically onion rings with a couple slices of sweet potato, and aa single piece of broccoli. I dipped my first piece in what I thought was the traditional sweet tasting sauce that is served with this dish, turns out it was straight soy sauce so salty I couldn't eat it. Tempura is supposed to be a very light tasting dish, ours was drenched in grease. Half way through stomaching our horrible appetizer the sushi chef comes to our table to tell us they are out of eel, which 2 of our 3 rolls contained, I was trying to be patient as we were both very hungry and agreed for him to substitute tuna in its place. When the plate of sushi finally came to us there was no wasabi or pickled ginger on tthe plate, I kindly asked the server for these two items  so he brings the plate back with about a pea size portion of wasabi and no ginger. Apparently they are out of ginger as well, so at this point I had enough ad was afraid to eat raw fish from this place. I asked to speak with a manager who did come to the table and proceeded to argue with me that EVERY Oriental market she went to was out oo ginger and wouldn't have any for months. She also said she brought in two bunches of asparagus and couldn't understand hhow they were out?? I won't even get into the sign outside the front door that says 40% off sushi from 8pm-2am, because the owner insisted on charging me for the tempura, which refectec no discount.  Avoid this place at all costs and hopefully another good sushi bar will move in this location as soon as they go out of business. Oh and its one star rating is only because there is no way to leave zero stars!!",2,"bad"
