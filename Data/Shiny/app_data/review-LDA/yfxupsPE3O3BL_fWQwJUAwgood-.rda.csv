"2","I'm glad we got here kind of early on a Friday, the place was packed by the time we left. It's an interesting vibe, a little noisy, no background music, almost a fast food kind of feeling with the booths... Not that that's bad, but it's unusual for a sushi place (in my experience).

Also unusual is the rather limited menu. There are plenty of maki options, but the fish selection seems limited to about 3 varieties - tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Oh, and shrimp and freshwater eel.

I decided to order off the cooked side of the menu since sashimi from that limited selection didn't inspire me too much. My wife decided to order nigiri off the sushi menu.

We went with a roll as a starter -- the Ninja. That turned out to be an excellent choice. A wonderful large portion of tuna in the center, perfectly cut slices of the other fish option across the top, and some perfect avocado slices as well. And the sushi rice was perfectly cooked. I was rethinking my no sashimi decision...

My wife selected yellowtail, ahi, and unagi as her sushi. She loves eel sauce. The fish was all presented well, expertly cut. But that was sadly very little eel sauce on that sushi. Overall, my wife enjoyed the other tastes though.

I ordered the dinner special - the Yakiniku - it was cooked thinly sliced beef with a side of steamed rice. Overall, it was good, but fairly bland for my tastebuds. I should've gone with the sashimi. If only they had a sushi combo bento box!

Overall, though, the place was clean, the service competent, the fish well-cut and presented, so we enjoyed the evening. I'd definitely go back.

TIP: Like other spots at Berry Farms (I'm thinking of you Tito's), the air conditioning system seems barely able to keep up with the Tennessee summer heat, so take that into consideration when you're planning your visit.",1,"good"
"3","Oh my God, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  I love this place!!  Yes!  

Chris and I were heading to Franklin for, you guessed it, Pokemon hunting.  I hadn't eaten yet because I couldn't find my can opener.  True story.  We decided to get some sushi.  Well, I did.  Chris doesn't like sushi, but I like him anyway.

This time I decided to opt for the tuna roll and the Philadelphia roll because I was feeling some cream cheese and avocado.  And of course the all-important miso soup.  Chris ordered beef gyoza as he is wont (and I guess what makes me stick around) and chicken udon.

Miso soup: amazing!  Perfect!  Best miso soup I've had in so long!  I want pints and pints!
Tuna roll:  So fresh!  So good!  Amazing!
Philadelphia roll:  DAMN, I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVE PHILADELPHIA ROLLS!
Beef gyoza:  Delicious!  Only complaint is I wish there'd been a bit of crispiness.  But that didn't stop me from eating half of them.
Udon:  Chris liked it.  There was something about it I didn't like.  I think I thought it'd be more like a soup.  Didn't matter.  I didn't order it and I had my delicious sushi and soup.

Afterwards I was raving about the place and Chris asked if we should bring our sushi-loving friend Thomas some day to which I enthusiastically said ""yes!!!!!!""  Fair warning, Chris:  you take Thomas without me and I will murder you in your sleep.

The service was also very friendly.  Very attentive and the hostess was very pleasant when we arrived and left.",2,"good"
