"2","We haven't visited this restaurant since it served solely Japanese cuisine;  maybe four years ago.  There have been positive changes to the decor in the dining room that reflect more of a Thai sensibility.  We were quickly greeted and seated.

Being hungry and wanting to try a variety of dishes off their new menu, we started with their Sampler appetizer ($10.99) and a bowl of Tom Kha with Chicken ($3.99).  The Sampler was surprisingly good with the star being their shrimp tempura.  Good sign!  The soup was also quite good.  We asked for the spice tray so that we could add a little heat to the soup however, all they offer is red pepper flakes.  I consider that unacceptable in any Thai restaurant.  Thai food begs for condiments of at least Sriracha and Fish Sauce along with the pepper flakes.

For entr√©es, we decided to try some sushi.  We ordered the Special Sunomono ($10.95), the Special Volcano Roll ($10.95), Tampa ($4.99) and Mexican ($5.50) rolls.  The sunomono was very fresh and had a great variety of white fish, salmon, octopus, shrimp and tuna.  The Volcano Roll was the star.  The Mexican was fine and the Tampa was OK but not our favorite.(see pics)

Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience.  Our server, Usara, was cheerful, chatty and helpful.  On our next visit, we will definitely try different Thai and Japanese offerings.  Like us, if you had some prior misgivings, please give them another chance.  I do not think that you will be disappointed!",1,"good"

It is a must try if you come. I would warn to stay away from the Thai food as its not that great. The house soup is a nice homemade broth, the ginger salad is yum-o. Green tea ice cream is really good. And one quirk I love about this place is there coca cola. It is always extra syrupy and it tastes soo sweet and good. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the change from solely Japanese to also Thai. The old staff knew my family by name and the old decor was fine with me.",2,"good"

My friend and I decided to go for sushi after we got a groupon for $11 for a $20 value. We were seated immediately and let our server know up front that we had it. They told us it was not good until 10/11. After looking at the groupon there, it was written, we just never read it, so that was our fault and really not a big deal as they also had a happy hour menu that we ordered from instead.

We decided to try the philly roll, tampa roll and mexican roll. While waiting for food I was looking around and noticed the wallpaper majorly peeling, water damage on the ceiling tiles and overall just a worn out look. I'm not a fan as I figure it might not be a good sign for how well they clean and maintain the kitchen.

When our food arrived, I really  liked the mexican and tampa roll. Both were excellent and made even better when we asked for a side dish of spicy mayo. The philly roll was not so great, didn't care for the texture. Our waitress dropped off our food and never returned to refill drinks or check in on how we were doing. The service gets a thumbs down from me. Finally, 20 minutes later another server altogether came by to clear the table and give us the check. We never saw our original server again. Since we got all 3 rolls on the happy hour menu (which is from 5 - 7), our total check was less than $20, not a bad deal.

I will be back again since we have the groupon, but overall I think there are better sushi places in the area.",1,"bad"
"5","Oh man. My second visit since they've changed hands and became Thai. Looking at the reviews, this place seems hit or miss, and it was a miss for sure. I love Sushi and I love Thai, but when Thai restaurants start doing sushi also, the sushi usually suffers. Joto used to be a Japanese place with Japanese staff and was my standard old faithful place to go for consistent sushi for almost 2 decades. No more. During my first visit one change I found was smaller portions and higher prices on the sashimi. I wasnt very happy about it but we eventually went back. On our second visit, the lack of cars in the parking lot should have been a sign. We sat at the sushi bar. I asked to see the menu with the special rolls, and was told by a new sushi chef they didnt have one. ? . He asked me what I was looking for. So we ordered some old favorite ""specials"" and then various items off the menu. They didnt have many ""specials"" written on the board, and what they did have were rolls named after super heroes, Thor, Hulk, etc. They were way overpriced at approximately $12 and $13 each. I asked if they were the large rolls and he said No. So we didnt order those. The rolls we did order were too loosely wrapped, 3 or 4 of them falling apart. Any roll that contained a fried ingredient was gross. You could tell just by the color of the fried food. Change your grease! We had a scallop roll, the same roll I've always ordered, which was the fishiest tasting food I've ever had there, and this guy made the roll differently and omitted ingredients. Changing things that have been the same for so long is NOT a good idea. We had steamed chicken which looked and tasted good. However, we took home left overs to give to our dogs and when cutting up the thicker pieces they were almost raw in the middle. In all I'd say there were only 2 things out of about 10 that we didnt have some complaint about. So I dont know if it was just an off night, or if this sushi chef was new, or if their Thai offerings are really good, but I'm not going to find out as this was probably our last visit. Sad.....",2,"bad"
