"2","This is hands down the best new restaurant in Nashville!!  I live nearby and have been eagerly waiting for them to open up. My best friend and I decided to go there on a Thursday night. We had the best time and amazing dinner!  We sat at the bar and the entire bar staff was so friendly and amazing. We felt extremely welcomed and enjoyed our delicious martinins. I had a thr filet and my best friend had a seafood dish. DEFINITELY THE BEST DINNER I HAVE HAD IN A WHILE!!  

Not only was this an amazing atmosphere but the entire staff was friendly. The GM and managers stopped by throughout our night and made sure everything was perfect.  You can chose anywhere to eat, but the staff always makes your experience along with the food.  The most important part about my visit was feeling safe in an environment to go out and eat. They are extremely organized and have an amazing system. Seating is separated and staff were all wearing masks with temperatures being checked at the door.  This is important during a time like this.  

If you want to enjoy yourself and still feel safe, GO TO RIVERHOUSE!!!!  Atmosphere,  amazing staff all around, great food and drinks!!  Thank you RiverHouse for making our experience unforgettable.  We will be back soon",1,"good"
"3","My husband, myself, mom and her friend had dinner here a few nights ago and had a wonderful experience all around. We were super excited to try River House as some friends had dined there recently and loved it and we were not disappointed.  From making the reservation on the phone to the valet who said goodnight and the end of the evening-- start to finish fantastic.  Atmosphere was somehow both contemporary and cozy at the same time.  Beautiful tile floor in the entry way, large rectangular bar with a retro clock, lovely leather booths, nice millwork on the walls..... I could go on and on.  Hostesses were friendly and efficient. Our waitress, who had just started the day before, did a very nice job. Our cocktails were all well balanced and delicious ( and I'm super fussy about that).  Music selection was enjoyable and not overly loud (another thing I'm super fussy about). My mom ordered the oysters Rockefeller for her appetizer and enjoyed them so much that she wouldn't share:-). Caesar salad and wedge salad were both very yummy as were the complimentary hot water corn cakes with butter-- the best I've ever had by far.  Our table's entrees were: sea bass, steak au poivre, grouper, and filet.  Not one bite  was left on any of the plates.  Food was so so good. And we also ordered the carrot cake and key lime pie!  By far the best carrot cake I've ever had and the key lime also received rave reviews (though I didn't get to taste that one).  We will definitely go back as often as possible.  Highly recommend.  Keep up the good work River House!  Glad to have you in Nashville.",2,"good"
