"2","my husband and i always get the groupon for fulins when it comes up.  it's one of our favorite places to go for a ""nicer"" dinning experience. the steamed chicken dumplings appetizer is one of our favorites, and the egg flower soup is pretty splendid as well...i will actually go to fulin's just because i'm craving egg drop/flower soup.  we've always had great service here too. the servers have a professional manner, which my husband and i appreciate for a calm, nice dinning experience. 
reading through some of the other reviews, the chicken i've gotten has always been cooked perfectly, the california roll is pretty yummy, and i think they do nice job of serving delicious food from several ethnic cuisines. 
awesome: steamed chicken dumplings; egg flower soup, general tsu's chicken, mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and spicy sesame beef.",1,"good"
"3","Fresh everything-and I'm vegan. I ordered the Joy Roll and they gladly substituted asparagus for the cream cheese and it was above par, very much so. See the pic! Fresh!!!! I ate every. single. piece. Then, the superbly friendly waiter said she could probably approve my request to substitute broccoli in place of the chicken in the Chicken with Cashew Nuts entree. It was the bomb! The lo mein noodles were the bomb-what can I say-they were the bomb, see the pic. Better yet-go there-give them your biz so I can continue to frequent them because they're in my neighborhood. Excellent service from my new girl Christy. The place could use a deep clean but you should see my house; I'm short-staffed toooo!!!",2,"good"
