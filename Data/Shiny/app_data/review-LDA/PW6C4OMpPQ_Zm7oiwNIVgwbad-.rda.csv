"2","One of my favorite spots for to go Hibachi was O.E.C. In St Pete. Since moving to Seminole, I don't go as often as I'm not in that neck of the woods as much. So I was thrilled to find out that they opened up a new location here in the Seminole/Largo area! As far as the food quality, it is just as good, if not better than the food in the St Petersburg location. Meat is fresh, veggies are cooked well and the rice is abundant. The yummy sauce is still fantastic and the miso salad dressing is still my favorite dressing ever! I've had hibachi here several times already and it's been consistently good. The sushi is still slightly above average, but not the best by any means. The lunch special remains a good deal (two rolls and a soup or salad for $7.99) but I'm a bit disappointed they don't have the dinner deal for $10 like the other location. Not sure why. Either way, there are not many places around you can pick up an order of hibachi without having to have the ""dining experience"" of sitting around the hibachi grill. Those restaurants are fine for entertainment, but sometimes you just wasn't the food sans the show. Check em out!",1,"good"
"3","A modest mom and pop shop that serves extraordinary food. Their sushi, sashimi, and rolls are fresh and generously portioned. There are quite a variety of rolls that would suit anyone's needs.
In addition, there are Japanese and Chinese dishes available as well as Asian Fusion dishes like their noodle soups, tempura, and stir fry dishes.
They have an impressive selection of appetizers made either cooked or fried or raw. They have an equally impressive selection of soups and salads made to order.
I'm also impressed with the selection of beers and wines including a variety flavored sake and plum wine .
The kids get a kick out of the imported soda pop drinks and their unique dessert selection.",2,"good"
"4","Anjou serves pan-Asian cuisine, particularly Japanese and Korean fare.

I made reservations for two 6 pm Thursday. Upon our arrival we were seated immediately. Only a couple other tables were occupied which wasn't surprisingly, considering the day.

My friend thought the decor was out of place and didn't fit any conceivable theme. If anything there were Japanese elements but only on the lower floor. The lower floor has a sushi bar, a lounge with a big screen TV (the better to read karaoke lyrics), and more bathrooms.

Our server (Sarah) was friendly but after taking our orders and bringing our food out she was nowhere to be found. (Interesting trivia - none of the waitstaff or kitchen staff appeared to be asian. Conversely, I've seen Cajun restaurants run by only asians.)

When we left an hour later only a few parties (I'm using the term liberally) had wandered in. Reservations recommended if you go on Friday or Saturday night, when it does get crowded.

I wouldn't go here - the food (kalbi, shumai, calamari, and udon noodles) was all average and was soured by the poor service.",1,"bad"
"5","It was a Saturday night and market st in Philly was swarming with people. My friends and I checked 2 restaurants but they both had over an hour long waits. The wait at Anjou? Non existant. That should have been a red flag right there but we were starving and they had couscous on the menu, April's fave.

The menu wasn't cheap but the food sounded good. Marco and Karina ordered the ""Chilean Sea Bass w/ Tarot puree, heart of palm salad, atop a miso glaze [26]"". April ordered the ""Pan Seared Red Chile Norwegian Salmon, Sweet peas & couscous in a sun dried tomato, red pepper sauce [22]"" because again, she was seriously craving couscous. A fourth companion, Megan, ordered the ""Bi Bim Bap- A medley of vegetable & egg julienne, served with two traditional Korean sauces and a bowl of miso soup (available without beef) [16]."" I opted for the ""French Cut Chicken Breast, Wasabi gnocchi, wild mushrooms, & asparagus in a sweet garlic ginger sauce [22].""

All sounds delicious doesn't it? Yeah, we thought so too.

First problem. A chip in my glass that was sharp enough to cut a lip. I didn't get cut but I could have! Did I mention the plastic shard at Cheesecake?? The waitress apologized and gave me a fresh glass. Fine, no biggie. 

Second problem. They ran out of gnocchi for my chicken and tried to push the mashed potatoes. Hey, I can make that at home for a dollar. No thanks. So they said they can do risotto. Fine, no biggie.

Third problem. A very, VERY long wait. For a restaurant that wasn't very busy, they sure like to take their time. Maybe they were trying to lure other unsuspecting people from the outside by pretending that they have a full happening place like the rest of them but my friends and I had no interest in being part of their marketing gimmick. We just wanted to be fed! The food had better be worth the wait....

Fourth problem. We finally received our entrees and I immediately recognized a problem. April, the poor innocent patron who had ordered the salmon because of the couscous received, before her, a plate looking very barren with a piece of salmon the size and shape of a sleeve of laffy taffys, 6 or 7 halves of asparagus, and NO COUSCOUS. BIG BIGGIE.

""Where's her couscous?!"" I blurted out. That's when we noticed that nearly all our dishes were missing crucial elements from the menu. 

The chilean sea bass was NOT served with mashed taro and hearts of palm salad. just a ring of MASHED POTATOES. Maybe I should have asked what ""french cut"" meant because now I know that it means ""slice a chicken breast as thin and flat as possible to try to cover the plate and keep down costs."" My wild mushrooms must've gone loco because they were nowhere on my plate. Maybe they were partying it up with my asparagus because they were also m.i.a. My risotto? Oh it was there all right, resting on my plate like a pale, sticky dome of something that resembled MASHED POTATOES! Since when is it okay to be able to scoop risotto with an ice cream scooper?? 

We were not happy campers. We went on a hunger strike. The host went back to the kitchen to find out what happened. He came back and informed us that ""they ran out of the couscous, and the mashed taro"" AND the gnocchi??? And the wild mushrooms??? What do you have back there, a 50 lb bag of instant MASHED POTATOES??? 

The rest is blur. I remember telling the host/waiter/customer service you can't just change an order without asking the patron if it's fine with them. He agreed and took care of the drinks that we had ordered. That much they did right. We still left a tip for the waitress because we felt horrible that she has to tell family and friends that she works there. 

We left. Still hungry and livid. The waitress was outside crying and smoking a cigarette. Poor girl, I hope she moves on to a decent establishment like Hooters or Fudruckkers. I wish her well.

The 5 of us went down the street to Soho Pizza and scarfed scrumptious slices for 2.50 a piece. And when I ordered the mushroom and broccoli pizza, both mushrooms AND broccoli appeared on my slice. See, other people can do it, why can't Anjou? 

Unless you want mashed potatoes, don't go here. 

EDIT 1/19/10- 
It has come to my attention that this dreadful place is now CLOSED. VICTORY!!!!",2,"bad"
