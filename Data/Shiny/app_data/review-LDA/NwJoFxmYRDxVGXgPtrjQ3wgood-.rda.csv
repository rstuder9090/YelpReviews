I admittedly haven't been back because there are newer Thai restaurants that are closer to me. My visit this past week was for an impromptu team lunch. There were hits and misses, but it was still a very enjoyable lunch.

First of all I must comment on the ornate decor that makes you feel like you're in an imperial Thai palace. It's very elegant and contributes greatly to the whole experience. The atmosphere and decor really sets Ploy Thai above the rest. The service is also very attentive, or at least it was during this lunch experience. I've been for dinner many times in the past and it was pretty top notch even back then. I think my favorite dinner item was the Basa Seafood in ginger sauce. I remember loving that sauce with the fresh ginger. Also, the Thai tea is always a winner.

My recent lunch experience was a little different. You actually get a bowl of chicken and rice soup, as well as a spring roll with your meal. Both items are delicious. A coworker ordered the Thai Crab Roll. I wish I had taken a picture of it. They looked like crab rangoons, but were stuffed with a fine mixture of crab and seafood. Way better than rangoons. This is one of their specialties that I would get again. I'm so glad I got to taste one. I also got the Duck Noodle Soup off their daily lunch menu. This was a bit of a miss for me. I was expecting the broth to be light and fresh like the one at Wat Mongkolratanaram. This broth tasted more like a cross between a pho and an udon noodle broth. It was more complex in taste, and maybe more of what someone would expect in a beef pho. It was a little sweet and sour which was kind of odd to me. The duck was plentiful but I would have expected the skin to be crispy. It had cilantro and crunchy garlic bits as well as wide noodles. The taste was okay, but it wasn't great. I also had to ask for a seasoning tray because it needed some kind of spice to give it a little heat. It's not something I'd order again. 

Other than that, everything was very good and as expected. My other coworkers loved their meals. One needed more seasoning for a dish that was supposed to already be spicy, but she liked it after adding chili oil and chili pepper flakes. Another had the fried eggplant with green curry that looked very good. I'll try that next time. Service was quick and professional. It's a great place for a business lunch, or any occasion.",1,"good"
"3","Wow! Ploy thai was voted the best Thai Restaurant in Brandon and I have to say that I concur! As soon as you first walk in, you are wowed by the amazing exotic unique authentic Thai decor and wall art!  Ploy thai management really did an amazing job decorating the place! We came for lunch and were promptly seated with no wait although the restaurant was fairly busy but the restaurant is pretty big inside occupying 2 store fronts with a large sushi bar are. We got a table for 8 with comfy booth seating on one side and chairs on the other side. I got the steak pad thai, thai hot and it was really good. My coworker got the kiss kiss bang bang because he hasn't gotten that in awhile lol. He said the kiss kiss bang bang was very satisfying but he could have had more kiss kiss bang bang lol. My other coworker got the Pad Ba Mae which comes with egg noodles, chicken, and mixed vegetables. My other coworker got the poke bowl and my other coworker got the panang curry and everyone enjoyed their meal! On our second visit, I got the Red Curry Steak with coconut milk, bamboo shoots, and mixed veggies! I thought the spicy level for thai hot was a bit weak but was able to remedy the spice level with extra spices from the spice rack. My coworker who got medium hot said his felt spicier than last time. So perhaps the spicy level varies by dish or by personal preference. I almost got the spicy bamboo which also comes with red curry but is a stir fry! My coworker got the drunken noodles which is basically pad thai but with more vegetables ! Our service has always been quick and friendly. We Look forward to our next visit!",2,"good"
