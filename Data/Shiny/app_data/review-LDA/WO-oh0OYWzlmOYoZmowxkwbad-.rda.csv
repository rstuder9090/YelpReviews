"2","Seriously?  No one has reviewed Wasabi yet?  No one has declared the delights of the dynamite roll?  Not a single salutation of the sirloin?  No astonishment at my abundance of aimless alliteration?

And for crying out loud...the Yum Yum sauce, people.  WHAT ABOUT THE YUM YUM SAUCE?!

Sorry about that.  In all seriousness, I really do adore this place.  I mean, granted, if you've been to one hibachi place, you've been to most all of them.  What's that?  On onion volcano?  I never would have expected that...

What set's Wasabi apart are two things.  One, the joyful quirkiness of the hibachi cooks.  One puts out his onion-cano fire using a slightly naughty little boy figurine that shoots a stream of water from his...well...boy bits.

Then there's the very Asian hibachi chef who has perfected an extremely spot on, just twisted enough version of a ""southern"" accent.  Wonderful.

The second thing that sets Wasabi apart.  The sushi.  Specifically the dynamite roll (will not make ""Good Times"" joke...will not make ""Good Times"" joke).  Seriously, though, it lives up to it's name.

Oh, and if you go, check out the faucets in the bathrooms.  For some reason, they fascinated me.  I know, you were with me right up to this point.  But this is my review.  And if I wanna proselytize the plumbing, I will, darn it.",1,"good"
"3","I've been to lots of hibachi restaurants and this one is probably the best! We went during lunch, so it was cheap AND good. Everything was so fresh; the vegetables and rice and meat were all cooked perfectly and were of a good quality and you get a lot, portion-wise. They have this red pepper sauce that is a little spicy, a little sweet and I swear, it's SO good we bought some to-go and used it on lamb shawarma later! I'm a big fan. They set the bar high, so now I'm gonna have a hard time going to hibachi places that don't stack up! :/",2,"good"
"4","1 star bc she didn't make us pay for our drinks or soup. 

When we walked in, there was a rank smell. I was hesitant and so was my husband and best friend. But, it was my sons birthday and he has been looking Fwd to it all week. I know I know, I should have trusted the reviews. Since we have not lived here long, we went to the area of Providence for the sake of knowing it. 
We were taken to our table that was never cleaned. Clean plates were put down but it was greasy and had rice stuck to it. Not only that, but the cook top still wasn't clean and had remnants of food cooked from the last seating. A man came to clean it in front of us. I asked the server to clean the table too. Wearing flip flops, I was creeped out by all of the old rice in the carpet. Carpet where food is cooked is really weird to me any way. 
It was freezing! We were all cold to the point of wanting to put our arms in our shirts. The soup came out. That warmed us up a bit. I told the server it was freezing and she said, ""oh really? Someone at the other table said the same thing.""  Ok then change the thermostat! 
Went to the bathroom. Smelled like dirty diapers. Ugh. 

So after she took our soup bowls, she said she would be right out with our salads. 10 minutes went by and no salad. Then 2 more people sat down to join us and we knew they were going to have to look over the menu, give drink orders, order and have their soup before we could move forward. 
There were two other full tables there that looked like they had been there awhile. As we waited for salads, a cook came out to cook for one of them. Before that, it was very uncomfortable. No music.  Nothing. Just sitting there in silence. The hoots and hollers from the other table towards the cook (who looked like he could care less) was mildly entertaining. 
The other table sat there. Some who didn't order hibachi were already eating. I was suspecting our salads weren't out bc they were short staffed and they were trying to stagger them to buy time. I was afraid we were gonna be there another hour and a half after being there for 40 minutes for a sweet tea and soup. 
Then my husband showed the the little pitcher of soy sauce. It was covered in old rice on top of the lid!!! That's it, I am out!!!
We went to the desk with the soy pitcher in hand to complain about the nastiness. She understood and didn't make us pay for the drinks or soup. 
We left and went to Oishii. So if you are looking for hibachi mildly close to Providence, I highly recommend it. I have already reviewed them on sushi under my profile. We called to check and see if the did hibachi and they were expecting us when we got there. Very clean, staff is personable and food is delish! The shrimp was so much bigger compared to Wasabi. 
Will never be back to wasabi.",1,"bad"
"5","""Hibachi chicken, Hibachi steak and shrimp with a side of rice, veggies, soup, salad and you get a side of extreme rudeness from the manager at no extra charge! What more could you want! It was a very poor setup and experience for a birthday party of 11 basically adults at the hibachi grill...""

We are celebrating a family birthday on a Sunday afternoon. We got there at the perfect time - right before the Baptist! There were 11 of us and we requested the dog and pony show at the grill - although I prefer the regular service at a table - same food - they just don't throw shrimp at your face or have a hokey plastic fireman fake pee or ""squirt you"" with a piece of brown string out of an empty sauce bottle...

We are seated and we have had this same number once before, but there were 12 of us with no issue. The set-up is like most hibachi grills - two grills back to back in a u-shaped configuration with seating for 18-20 I think. My wife and I are basically sitting in what could be construed as the area for the other grill...again we have done this a couple times and it was not a problem. Another party of two is seated at the same area a little bit later. Your highness the manager comes to our ""cook"" and points at an imaginary dividing line separating my wife and I from our party and tells the cook another cook will take care of us even though our order is taken with our party. Cart is rolled out with raw ingredients for everyone but my wife and I...the other couple is having a drink and perusing the menu so they aren't ready to order. Guess I could have yelled across the table - ""Hey! Hurry up and order! We're hungry!"" But that would put me in the same class as the manager - RUDE! 

Everyone else is getting the big show and food put on their plates while my wife and I sit and watch them eat. My wife goes to the manager and complains and very rudely he says, ""Trust me! You get your food!"" Other couple orders - finally - and eventually a cart comes out. The manager is standing in sight and I lift my hands - palms open - like ""well?"" He intentionally mocks me with the same gesture and a smirk on his face then points to the cart - which proceeds to go to another table - HA! Jerk! Finally another cart appears to serve my wife and I and the other couple. We are about 10 minutes behind the rest of our party. I do have to admit, though, we got a lot more rice and veggies because of there were just four of us on that grill. Manager did tell the cook - ""No show - just cook!"" Which I was fine with, but the other couple paid for the experience...

Upon leaving the manager is in the lobby - I catch his eye and simply shake my head...he diverts his eyes...real jerk as witnessed by other reviewers...

I have a buy-one-get-one free dinner coupon worth $20, but I will never use it - it's not worth it...",2,"bad"
