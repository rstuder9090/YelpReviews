"2","Sushi burritos, poke bowls, and sushi rolls OH MY! I really enjoyed my experience here at Zukku despite my inability to try most of the delightful menu items (#pregnancyissues)! 

The ordering process was easy, they have a new set up where they have laminated menus available on a stand/easel type thing in the area where the line forms and you mark your orders with a Vis a Vis marker. The intake person/ cashier at the monitor was pleasant and entered my order efficiently. The other staff on board were also cordial and helpful despite being busy. 

I ordered a little bowl with a melange of different vegetables and substituted brown rice for the white that is standard. I was happy to see that shiitake mushrooms were available as an add on (for an additional $1). The mushrooms in my bowl were delicious as were the other vegetables, I felt they were cooked perfectly! I liked the medley of fresh ingredients together. 

All of the orders of the group I was with came up fast-I was impressed! There is a station for soy sauce and chopsticks off to the left once you pick up your order. My friends had the sushi burritos and raved about them. They also mentioned the filling:rice ratio was adequate. I look forward to trying one on a subsequent visit. 

As some other reviewers mentioned, I did feel the price point is a bit higher than one might expect but they are a new business with fresh ingredients and there is overhead people! Overall I was very pleased with my purchase. This vendor, as with many at HPM, only accepts credit or debit cards.",1,"good"
"3","Growing up in Los Angeles, sushi and poke were always staples in my diet. The make your own poke bowls are delicious and a great way to satisfy your sushi/poke craving. 

Pros: it's located in armature works so if other members of your party aren't the biggest fans of raw fish or sushi, they can choose other dining options and you can eat together. If you choose your own bowl, you can choose 3 embellishments ( my go to date edamame beans, cucumber, roasted corn, and seaweed salad (worth the extra .50 cents!) and unlimited things to ""finish it up"" so lots of picked peppers, red onions, togarashi (spicy seasoning so good!) scallions cilantro tempura chips and others. Probably the biggest pro is that the fish is so FRESH. What keeps me coming back to this place. Free parking in large lots, if you wait around for a couple minutes you'll easily find a spot

Cons: it's armature works so if you go at a busy time, practically always, it can be hard to find a place for your party to sit and enjoy your meal together. Sushi and poke is expensive, as expected but that's what you get for quality fish. I personally always go with the big poke bowl so you can choose two different proteins (my go to's are salmon and tuna) 

Overall, this place is worth the price. Have yet to try their rolls but their poke bowls are wonderful",2,"good"
"4","I'm giving one star to what used to my be favorite sushi bowl place for the past two years. I used to frequent this business Monday through Friday with no fail. Due to COVID I no longer work 2 min away from here and when I want a bowl I drive 40 minutes now. With all the new staff who are not knowledgeable regarding the rewards system they have had for two years, on the top of the way small portions now, it's just not worth the stress anymore. 
The last three times I've left stressed out cause my order is holding up the line cause no one knows how the reward system works. So I'm waiting there for 5 minutes while they fumble with the register and my food starts to wait and the line piles up.
I hate being the reason why people are not getting their food timely but I also feel that the workers should know what they're doing.
Today was the last straw. The excuse I got was ""well no one does the rewards"" as to why they don't know how to do that part. It's frustrating and now that the portions have gone down drastically but the price hasn't, it's just not worth the trip here or not worth visiting when I'm at Armature Works.",1,"bad"
"5","I visited Zukku at Armature Works on a Sunday afternoon. Luckily I was able to find a table close by where they were calling numbers when food orders were complete. 

 Zukku is located in Armature Works which is such a great spots and there are many restaurants to enjoy. I was in the mood for a Asian style bowl so I opted for this restaurant. I ordered a make your own bowl with two proteins and added a few additional items that cost an additional $.50. I also opted for greens in my bowl instead of brown rice or white rice. This all came out to about $16 with a 10% tip. I'm not sure why I tipped because the only thing the employees did was take my order, prepare my food, and calling number. When I receive the bowl it looked looked as if it was heaping with food but then I realized it was just large pieces of greens and it was actually a very small.  Slivers of avocado, a teaspoon of shredded carrots, one slice of zucchini.  Of course a little of the tuna and salmon.  The bowl was fine but I was not looking to spend $16+ on food and finish hungry.",2,"bad"
