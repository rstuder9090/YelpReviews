"2","I was well on my way to a revisit of Newk's Eatery across the street when I picked up the Yelp app to check out the area restaurants. I spied Community Manager Niki's review and laughed when she described the atmosphere of Daddy Jack's as outdated. Since I'm a good 20+ years older than Niki, I figured Daddy Jack's would be perfect for me. Strangely enough, Daddy Jack's ended up being almost exactly what I expected. 

Thanks, Niki!

So, instead of Newk's I headed into the strip center housing Daddy Jack's and its sister restaurant, the somewhat more higher end Kona Jack's. This strip center has always been a little odd in terms of wheelchair access - it basically has it, but it's not actually ADA compliant as the parking spots don't have the metal signs and the curb cuts, while decent enough, are in kind of odd locations. Once I found a spot, however, I had a curb cut nearby and almost directly in front of Daddy Jack's. The covered entrance has a glass door entryway and I was impressed that someone was at the door ready to greet me. 

At first, I thought I might be looking at an inaccessible restaurant. As you enter, there's a hosting area to your left and a large bar area to your right. To your left, there's a row of tables. However, all of it is elevated - even the hosting area. It's kind of odd. However, I was relieved to find out they have an area in the back that includes regular tables that are accessible. However, you should note that you have to wheel through the narrow aisle next to the bar to get to them - it's kind of tight even in my smaller, manual chair. People were perfectly friendly, but if the place had been packed it would have been challenging. 

I was seated at one of the tables in the backs, televisions are on the wall with overhead music playing a mixture of oldies and pop/rock. My server, Cindy E., was a rock star and is largely the reason for the 4-star rating. The menu includes a variety of meal/sandwich options and you can also order the famed sushi from next door at Kona Jack's. 

I ordered a B.Y.O. burger, medium well. It comes with chips, though for $2 you can upgrade to a side. I opted to upgrade to steak fries. I contemplated a nicer meal, but really was in the mood for simple and a quality burger sounded good. With my usual unsweetened iced tea, the bill came in at just over $16 - not bad, but definitely a bit of a splurge. It's fairly average in terms of value as the burger, served on a sesame seed bun, is a good sized burger but the steak fries struck me as a bit slight for a $2 upcharge and I doubt I'd order them again. 

The burger was delivered as ordered, a nice sandwich that satisfied me and was definitely worthy of the $10.50 charge. My iced tea was refilled once and I was given one to go. 

Even though I'm 20+ years older than Niki, I tend to agree with Niki on the atmosphere. It has a retro-steakhouse/bar type feeling, but the tables in the back are fairly packed in and it lacks the relaxed, casual feeling of those types of bar/grill joints. It wasn't uncomfortable at all - it just wasn't nearly as comfortable as I'd expect. That, coupled with the accessibility concerns would likely keep me from adding Daddy Jack's to my regular rotation. 

Overall, I wrestled with 3-4 stars. When a place doesn't quite make my usual rotation, then I usually defer to 3 stars. However, I really liked the service here and the food was solid if a bit slight in terms of value. I would probably go 3.5 if I could, but 3 stars simply feels to low. So, 4 stars it is with the disclaimer that this would be more of an occasional, splurge type setting for me than a regular spot. However, if you're in the area and in the mood for something a little finer than a Newk's or a McAlister's then this may very well be a great place to try.",1,"good"
"3","It has been years since I've left a review for Daddy Jack's and it's time to update.

Daddy Jack's is located in the Lifetime Fitness strip center close to the intersection on Meridian and 96th Street (East side of Meridian). Parking has changed with the Pandemic and all the front row parking is now reserved for carry-out or curbside service. Of course, the large parking lot provides an abundance of free parking.

The elevated hostess stand is on the left as you enter. The cozy interior still has lots of warm woods, tables and chairs in the back with banquette booth seating along with full booths. A large bar is in the center of the main dining room filled with regulars grabbing a drink and/or dining. Six flatscreens are located throughout the restaurant. The isleway is narrow getting to the back tables or the 2nd dining room but doable.

We have been here several times in the past few weeks and found the service has greatly improved and the food has been delicious. They serve lunch and dinner with a menu offering appetizers, excellent Clam chowder, salads, burgers, sandwiches, hand-cut steaks, seafood, chicken and pasta dishes. Kona Jack's is just next door and you'll receive a sushi menu as well as the regular dinner menu.

A few items we've ordered is the amazing Blacken Tenderloin Sandwich (seriously and deliciously blacken), the Seafood Fettuccine with tender scallops, crab, shrimp in a light cream sauce. The Seafood Diavola is my favorite with shrimp and scallops tossed with Cajun Seasoning, marinated tomatoes, basil, garlic, red onions with linguine noodles. I asked for extra Cajun Seasoning to add a touch more heat.

Daddy Jack's has been in business for over 30 years and the food was terrific, the service was on the money and we had a pleasant meal. Drop in and give it a try if you haven't.",2,"good"
"4","My first time and the band soul bus was nice. Why they call themselves soul bus I don't have a clue. They weren't playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones. Nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them. It's like an after thought..they just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look.  They knew they had a show! when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act? One cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all. 
   I was told is was a classy place..NOT more of a old gentleman's club feel and outdated looking. Had the sushi..gag me. I have had better wont order that again if I return to Daddy Jacks. My guy Aaron at Kroger 79th and fall creek makes it better! it's yummy! He's from Thailand if that helps he is a sushi master.
  I also tried the buffalo shrimp. Okay I'm thinking these may be what I'm familiar with from my Ann Arbor Michigan experience ..YUCK!  not even close. No batter not even a dusting just 12.50 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce. It's beyond laughable..where is the skill in that?  The Corona is always tasty can't mess that up.One thing for certain folks..fool me once that's all you get outta me, I don't fall for it twice when my money is involved.",1,"bad"
"5","My husband took me to this establishment on my birthday for live music and cocktails. Upon entering,  the hostess was very nice and directed us to the back bar. The area was secluded and fitting for a nice evening, until this disgruntled, old, short, heavy-set, blonde waitress (sorry, didn't get her name) came to our table. We asked for the specials and were told there were 2. Cosmopolitans and a beer. I asked what was in the cosmopolitan and with attitude she said, ""it's basically alot of vodka and cranberry juice"". I replied, ""oh, a vodka and cranberry?"" To which she replied,  ""No! Double vodka and a splash of cranberry juice."" (??) I laughed it off, asked about their long island and whether it was one of those mixes...she said no I never heard of that,  so I ordered it. It was a mix! My hubby ordered a cosmopolitan so instead of sending mine back, we traded.  Curious about the recipe, I looked up cosmopolitan. If you're like me and 'cocktail time' is important,  you want the right stuff. Theirs had a lemon strip with no lemon flesh in it and no lime or triple sec. So, for the next round,  I asked for a lime, she asked me why.. (??), so I explained that I wanted to try it with lime instead ...""well you have lemon""  ""..umm, can I please just have a lime?"" The next thing I know, this waitress stomps away, then back with a lime and proceeds to squeeze a lime into my drink with her fingers, then shake them off in my drink! I am livid, I send the drink back and we notify, my husband pays the bill and we ask for management. What does he do...NOTHING to help. He's condescending and obviously scared of the waitress. The story is so much longer. I was treated so disrespectfully...my feelings were so hurt and she never even apologized. I will NEVER EVER go to this horrible place again. And every chance I get,  I'm going to tell others just how unprofessional and malicious I was treated...they need etiquette and customer service training, the manager needs a backbone and that waitress needs to find another line of work!",2,"bad"
