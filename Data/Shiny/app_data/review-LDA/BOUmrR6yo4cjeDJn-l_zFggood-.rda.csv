"2","Amazing Asian food restaurant in Roxborough, Manayunk area. Me and my wife really enjoy Dream House. Thank God it's something different than the average Chinese food restaurant.

Here are the positives;

Inside is very nice, modern, and clean. A great place to get sushi with friends, or go on a date with the wife. The host/waiter is extremely friendly!

Thai food section on the menu is unique! I tried the Thai Curry and it was very delicious. Not too strong, not too coconut milk tasting. The rice was very good. I also had The House Specialty, Crispy Beef. It came over salad with a special soy sauce. Me and my wife loved this! 

I read that another reviewer said that the Gen Tso had pineapple that's awesome! Sick of regular Chinese food.


Negatives;

Be more specific on menu. Could use better more modern, and more descriptive menu! This would have prevented the General Tso -Pineapple problem as they could have two kinds listed, one with pineapple and one without. Or the menu could have been more explicit about it having Pineapple in it in the first place.

Warning the veggie dumplings are very unique. Kind of like egg roll style filling (or also similar to cole slaw), not bad though, they should specify on their menu that this is very different as some people will be surprised.

I'm a big fan of Dream House and will go here again! If the menu get's better I'll give this place 5 stars!",1,"good"
"3","We decided to explore restaurants in the Roxborough/Manayunk area and stumbled upon this place.

The menu is big, but most of it is Americanized Chinese food, which me mostly avoided.  We ordered Bento Box specials, which were an incredible deal--$9 for a huge amount of food: soup, sushi, salad, rice, two dumplings, and an entree.  There was also complimentary tea, which tasted like some sort of mild, roasted tea like hojicha or roasted barley tea.

The sushi was top-notch; it was just a California roll, but it was the best California roll I've had in a long time.  There was only a sparing amount of rice around the outside of the roll, and it was very generous with the other ingredients, which were very fresh.

I ordered the salmon green curry and it was exquisite...it came with the skin on (which I like) but was cooked so it was tender and easy to eat, and there were no bones in it.  That's tricky to do!  The sauce was mild--I'm used to Thai green curry being spicier and there was little kick but it was flavorful.

We got hot and sour soup with our meal and it was good, again, not very hot, but good.  The only thing I was less a fan of were the dumplings, which were a crab rangoon-style dumpling, cream cheese and crab, too heavy and not really my thing.

I would come back here though.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was very good, especially the sushi.  I want to try more extensive sushi here because I was so impressed with the quality of the California rolls.",2,"good"
