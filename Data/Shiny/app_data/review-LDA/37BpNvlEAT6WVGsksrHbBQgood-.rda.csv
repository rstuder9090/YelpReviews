"2","OK, a little background first; I'm a Southerner born and bred, not quite Redneck but have little use for fad food joints and yuppies.  I try not to go north of the Mason-Dixson  Line any more than I have to.  I can catch a Gulf Coast Amberjack, clean him, and  have him in the skillet in the blink of an eye.  I have both Tennessee limestone spring water and Gulf Coast salt water flowing in my veins.

So what do I think of some Yankees from Boston that think they can come down South and fry a piece of fish?  

Yes they can!

My yuppie nephew said I should try the place.

First impression was the high noise level.  Not good.  

Second impression was the two young Caucasian guys rolling Sushi (no kidding) in a place for FRIED fish.  Really not good.

I though to myself that this was just NOT going to work out.

I laughed at the thought of ordering oysters or mussels as I won't eat an oyster if I'm more than a hundred miles from Apalachicola.  And up til now, all the mussels I've tried in Nashville tasted like they walked from the bay on their own.

So I  played it safe and ordered the fish and fries.

It was GREAT!  The fish was a good sized portion and thick.  It had a wonderful, crispy crust, not that  crunchy corn meal southern batter but a light flour coating, probably double dipped. 

 It was fried to perfection, light and fluffy all the way through and piping hot.

The fries came in a paper bag and were a little mushy.  But to be honest, I had ignored them for the first 15 minutes and not even opened the bag to let them breath.

My son had some pasta dish with mussels which I thought was going to be a big mistake.  Due to the huge portion, he couldn't finish it which was good because his brother and I were stealing bites of it every chance we got.  I ended up eating four of those mussels.  

Don't know who the supplier is but they get them there fresh and Batter and Fried knows how to prepare them for the table.  The mussels were actually tender with a buttery, well seasoned finish.

The shrimp was OK for Nashville fare.  But remember, you're reading a review from a fellow that has off loaded his own from the boat and taken them straight to the kitchen.

I saw a platter of oysters at the next table and they looked tempting.

The servers were friendly and helpful.  Mine brought me a taste of the coconut sauce they have.  I never saw anything like that in a Boston fish house.  If that is what drives the Coconut Shrimp dish then I'm all for trying that one next time.

Nephew says seating is the trick to a quieter experience.  But I wasn't paying too much attention to the noise after that good food landed on the table.

It is a definite ""must return"" on our dinning list.

Heck, I'll even accessorize my bibbed overalls with a Boston Red Sox baseball cap.",1,"good"
"3","If you have a desire for some fried seafood, consider Batter'd & Fried as a good choice to find plenty of options to satisfy your hunger.  I went to B&F on a Sunday early evening for dinner.  Located in East Nashville, the restaurant is nice and cozy.  The staff is very welcoming once entering in the front door.  My boyfriend and I were ushered to a table near the back so we could watch some of the football game.  There is a bar area with televisions as well.  

There is a seafood menu and a sushi menu.  The sushi menu seemed interesting, especially with the mixed roll platters (which seem like an economically good deal for those wanting to try a variety of different sushi rolls).  Another reason to come back and try things from this menu...and also because they are apparently voted as best sushi in Nashville.

We decided to stick with the seafood menu.  Of the items that caught my eye from the appetizers list, such ceviche, crab cakes, calamari and mussels, we chose the mussels.  They did not disappoint.  The shells seemed super delicate (more so than usual). The mussels' broth was nice and savory and perfect to pair with the bread that it came with.   Next, our entrees...I chose the ""off the grill"" scallops, paired with mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day (asparagus).  My boyfriend ordered ""off the grill"" tuna with mashed potatoes.  When the plates were presented, I was happy with my tasty scallops, which sat in a garlic butter sauce.  The mashed potatoes were very, very plentiful.  In fact, after a few spoonfuls, I decided to just box them up and take them home.  For reference, this one leftover served as a side of two people the next day...so, the point, I got a mountain full of potatoes.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, was not too happy with his tuna.  Looking at it, it seemed to look overcooked as it was advertised to be ""seared.""  I have had better looking seared tuna at food chains like Bonefish Grill.  He asked me if I wanted to try it, but I couldn't even bring myself to thinking that it would taste appetizing.  Also, they must measure it out in the kitchen because it barely even seemed like enough to satisfy hunger.  Our waitress, who was very attentive and responsive throughout the meal, came to our table and asked about the food and we did mention to her about the tuna.  The manager then appeared and stated that is how the tuna is prepared in their kitchen. Hmmm... well, have your chef google seared tuna and that it what all other kitchens are preparing. 

Other than the tuna, everything was good at B&F, from the service to the taste of the food.  I do want to go back to try the sushi and maybe some of the fried dishes.  I would also encourage others to give this place a try as well.",2,"good"
