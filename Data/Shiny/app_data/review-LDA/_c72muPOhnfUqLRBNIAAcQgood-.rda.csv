"2","So the price for the buffet is a little deceiving. I saw ""All you can eat sushi for $20.99 for dinner"" and I thought 'Wow. What a great deal.""  But actually, they have 3 levels that you can choose from and the prices go up depending on what level you choose. Level 1 is $20.99 but has basic rolls and some appetizers. Most of the specialty rolls (including rainbow and spider, etc.) are in Level 3 and cost $30.99 for dinner. It's still a good price if you get mostly specialty rolls since if you buy them separately, it would definitely cost most, but still deceiving since most buffets are one price for dinner. Also, the buffet is only Monday through Thursday. 

FYI, the buffet isn't one where the rolls are premade and you go up and choose from the bunch. You place your order with the waiter and they bring it out to you when it's made, which means that that rolls are fresh. 

I had read reviews that the service is slow at peak times so we went in for an early dinner. When we went, there was only one other person in the restaurant so the service was pretty fast. But the place started to fill up as we were wrapping up our meal so I can see how the wait can get long since when we were there was only 1 sushi chef and someone helping with the toppings/sauces. 

The place itself was very cute and the waiter and the girl helping with the sushi were very friendly.  

As for the food, the rolls were some of the best that I've had.  My friend and I were saying 'This roll is REALLY good.' after each one that we tried!  The sushi and the veggies in the rolls were very fresh- especially the avocado! I can't remember what all the rolls were but we ate a lot of the rolls in Level 3 and they were all very delicious. The ones that stand out in my memory are the AK47, Sunrise, Blue O and Cheeseburger (I was a bit skeptical about a Cheeseburger roll because it kinda sounded gross- sushi and cheeseburgers don't seem like they mix. But we couldn't get over how the Cheeseburger tasted just like a cheeseburger and it was actually really good!)

When we were finished eating, the waiter brought over a La Flama Blanca Roll and asked if we wanted it. He cautioned us that the chef had made it extra spicy because he accidentally put extra sauce on it.  The AK-47 was listed with 2 bombs in hotness and it wasn't hot at all, but the La Flama Blanca Roll was listed as 3 and let me tell you, I'm not sure if it's because it's the spiciest roll on the menu or because of the extra hot sauce but that roll was SPIC-Y!!!! I couldn't eat more than 3 of the rolls because it was so spicy! It seriously was too spicy to enjoy- I can't even remember what else was in the roll. All I can remember is that it was hot! Who know, maybe it's better with less sauce on it.",1,"good"
"3","tried this last week after hearing a few nice things. very much like!! i am a very unfussy sushi fan. i like simple rolls, casual atmosphere, and quality ingredients. this place really hit the spot. 

we made it for half price happy hour and sampled quite a few dishes. i think the agedashi tofu and the takoyaki were my favorites. the tofu was light and flavorful with bits of bonito and onion. the takoyaki were like little fried balls of octopus custard. YUM. tempura was thinly breaded with a good selection of veggies - asparagus, shiitake, pumpkin, sweet potato. seaweed salad was fine. nothing special, but a nice balance for all our fried stuff. like the calamari, which was EXCELLENT if a bit salty (friends didn't seem to mind). breaded in panko, with a little bit of heat, they came out looking like onion rings, but inside they were just the right tenderness. they were probably everyone else's fave. 

we ordered a pair of rolls, too. we got one california - lovely and pillowy and soft - and, upon request, yellowtail with scallion, my favorite.  it's hard to screw it up, but somehow easy to disappoint it the fish/rice/scallion are at all lacking in quality. this is probably the best execution i have had here in the city. cool & smooth tuna with slight bite & tang to the rice with a strip of clean green onion. i was super pleased with their roll. i will absolutely go back and order one of these every single time. A++ 

it was hot as heck in there - maybe something wrong with the AC? - and an automatic air freshener kept spraying cologne smell across our table, but they were apologetic about both. 

nice & attentive staff. and cool tea infusing contraptions if you order hot tea. 

with the half price happy hour we made out like full-bellied bandits. next time i'm going to make it for $1 nigiri night. 

overall, i think this is my new favorite sushi spot. quality stuff & casual enough that you can have a sushi night in absence of a special occasion to excuse the outrageous bill.",2,"good"
