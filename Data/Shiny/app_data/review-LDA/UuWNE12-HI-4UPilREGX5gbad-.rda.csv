"2","nice place to drop by at if your passing by on the road or making reservations for Habachi. first time there and they gave I and my wife free desert and honored the free California roll for checking in through the yelp app can you say awesome... staff is nice they seem to try to get to know the regulars that go there which is another plus AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! so ait back relax and enjoy your sushi or meal. the parking was also reasonable. great they also do delivery and pick up so if you want to stay home call and place an order for their delicious California roll and eel avocado roll I found to be at a Fair price from the cooked roll part of the menu, and the special rolls e.g Dragon roll etc also reasonable and plenty. just be careful when you break apart your chop sticks if too much force used may fly near another customer around you which space for sushi section of the restaurant is pretty close when you sitting behind one another. fast service too due to the plenty servers available. for the wasabi if it's your first time eating the small amount of green paste wasabi be light with it it is over powering and burns your through and nostrils.  oh and the light was dim for all the lovers out there.",1,"good"
"3","The wife and I dined here last night for what was a very delicious meal. If up to my Wife this would be a 5 star review, but I would give a 3 star (hence, the 4 star rating).


The Negatives:
1. What I found most disappointing was that the ""special"" menus advertised on their website were not available at all. We went in specifically for the Early Bird Special, a common offering of local Hibachi restaurants, and were told that there were no Early Bird specials. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding between my wife and the waitress, but the discounted pricing was not offered as advertised on their website.
2. As a related matter, the restaurant was very reluctant in honoring the Yelp check-in deal (Buy One-Get One 60%off). Why have two different deals out on the internet if you have no intentions of honoring them? The only motivation I can think of is to get customers in the door with false advertisements.*
3. I felt the portions were not inline with the prices.  Each of our meals were priced at $22+ each and we both left a bit hungry even after a full meal with soup and salad. Something I am not at all used to with other Hibachi restaurants. 

The Positives:
1. BYO with no corking fee was great. Additionally, the chef squirts saki into the mouths of all adults at the table. Two big pluses for alcohol drinkers.
2. The ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Bottom line, the food was good.
3. After much debate, the Yelp check-in deal was honored and we received a decent savings on the meal. Although, still more than the Early Bird pricing we were expecting.

Would I return? Eh, the verdict is still out because my wife loved it so much. So maybe on a special occasion (like her birthday) or for something like sushi. Unfortunately, as good as the meal was my budget conscious self would probably steer clear as there are other cheaper Hibachi options in the area.  And it's a little embarrassing to have to make an argument for a discount that the restaurant claims to offer.",2,"good"
"4","We bought a Groupon and decided to give this place a try since we had seen it driving by a few times and wondered what it was like. The service was poor and the food was also poor. When we walked in, there was hardly anyone there and even though we said that we wanted to look at the menu before sitting down, the waitress rushed us over to the Teppanyaki grill and sat us down.  There was only one other couple in the entire room.  We decided against it, so she took us back to the main dining area.  

As we were seated we told the waitress that we had a Groupon and she acknowledged it.  My husband ordered Chicken Teriyaki that was supposed to include soup ""and"" salad and rice (the menu indicated it), and I ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box. I don't know if it was because we used a groupon, but the waitress said that they would only honor his dish with either soup, or, salad.  My dish, according to the menu, was supposed to be $17.95, but she said that it was really $19.95, and that they had not updated the menu for both items!  Wait a minute, didn't they just have a grand opening?  So how can they have old menus that need updating???

Nevertheless, we waited for our meal.  The chicken teriyaki came out looking quite blah and the chicken seemed like it was already pre-cooked.  All they did was cut it into strips, place it on the plate and top it off with a totally bland sauce that tasted nothing like teriyaki.  The chicken teriyaki also came out barely warm, so its obvious that it was not freshly cooked, it may have just been nuked.  My salmon was hot, but it had only a tiny little bit of that same bland sauce on it.  The tempura was quite greasy and the California rolls were small and scant. Isn't this a Japanese restaurant? How can they get sushi and teriyaki sauce wrong?  

We we quite disappointed with our meal and the service.  We will not be returning.",1,"bad"
"5","Gross!!! If you can't make something so simple as a spicy tuna roll then I know not to try anything else on the menu. What a huge disappointment. First time and definitely my last. I ordered spicy tuna roll, salmon skin roll, and lightly seared scallop sushi and fried calamari. 

The calamari is clearly the frozen kind they just throw in the fryer with katsu sauce?! Katsu sauce for fried calamari is not even a Japanese thing. Usually a sweet and spicy sauce or just sriracha would do. Confusing! The scallop was overly seared. The salmon skin roll was just ok but at least my entire order didn't go to trash (just like my money) as this was the only decently edible item. The spicy tuna roll was horrendous! The minute I put It in my mouth I spit it out. Old rotten food! It had the weirdest texture and tasted foul! Gross! Never again and really annoyed!",2,"bad"
