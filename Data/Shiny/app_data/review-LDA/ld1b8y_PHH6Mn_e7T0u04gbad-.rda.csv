"2","Gachi Sushi & Noodles (8/10) is a nice, small sushi bar eatery that offers a wide selection of sushi and ramen dishes. Overall, a promising lunch venue especially if you want a nice bowl of noodles. They have two locations; today I went to the one at Terminal A.

AMBIANCE: (8.5/10)  It is a nice small quick stop restaurant with a nice bar seating area if you aren't in a rush.  The location is very quaint and in one of less busy parts of the airport, so it's a great place if you want a bit of quiet in the airport. I felt like I was able to relax and enjoy my meal without having to rush or worry about loud announcements interrupting my meal. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: (9/10) The staff is very friendly and attentive. I was offered seating promptly and my order was taken quickly. All the seating options were properly set up and had a very nice and clean presentation. Food came out in roughly 10 mins, so great timing on their part. 

FOOD: (7/10) 
Tonkatsu Ramen with Pork and Boiled Egg ($13 +$2 for the egg)
I previously saw some mixed reviews mentioning the ramen, so I decided to try it myself. It came out as a sizable portion, and I only managed to eat about 2/3 of it. It comes with only 3 pieces of meat, so I wish it came with more but it was reasonable. The meat was a bit chewy, but it still had lots of seasoning and flavor in it. The boiled egg was also very good although it tasted a bit salty. Overall the flavor of the super was powerfully flavorful but with a bit too much sodium for my personal tasting. This includes the broth which felt a little overbearing. Aside from the extra sodium that I tasted the other flavors worked very well together. The broth was nice and hot which was perfect for this cold day and it mixed well with the veggies (great complementary texture) along with the flavors from the meat. It would have been a higher rating from me if there were a bit more meat and a little less salty taste.",1,"good"
"3","I never thought I would give a airport restaurant five stars! I stumbled across Gachi when stuck in the Philadelphia airport. There were several flights delayed and the airport was bustling from 9pm to 2am when the last flight left. Even though the airport was full, big name restaurants in the airport were giving last call on food and beverages, but not Gachi. 
I was pleasantly surprised to find out they severed wine and they had delicious, fresh seafood. I had the franklin, which consisted of salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, and seaweed salad. The sushi was well priced, plentiful, and delicious. There is very limited seating in this spot but the staff also offered to take the food and beverage to go! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone traveling though the E terminal at Philadelphia airport!",2,"good"
"4","I'd give the food here three stars. I had the ""pork ramen here, and it's pretty much what one might expect from airport ramen: okay noodles, meh soup (NOT pork!), and hard, kind of dry pork. The pork is actually slightly sour which is a bit concerning, but it's cooked so I'll probably be fine? 

I reduced this from a meh three stars to one star because the menu clearly shows a photo of ramen with half an egg for $13 (that's a lot for crappy ramen!), but the egg is actually an extra $2 -- not mentioned anywhere on the menu. That is not okay.

I wonder if it costs extra to have fish included in the sushi.

Oh, and I found a pretty big piece of chicken in my pork ramen.",1,"bad"
"5","Stopped at the Gachi in the food court at Terminal B/C in the early afternoon of 6/4/2019 and ordered the tonkotsu ramen with pork (chashu) for $14. What I got was nothing like the picture shown above the counter. There was no ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago) as shown in the picture. The broth was definitely NOT tonkotsu (pork bone) broth.  It was canned chicken broth.  The chashu portions were decent, but there were no other ingredients except for a little corn, a little seaweed, and a very skimpy portion of noodles.  I left hungry and angry that I had been cheated out of $14 for a fake, falsely advertised bowl of glorified chicken broth.  If you're ever thinking of stopping here on your way through PHL, just don't.",2,"bad"
