"2","Our visit to this restauarant was probably the only time I've ever left a place feeling completely satisfied and that my money was well spent. The miso soup and edemame that comes on the house while you're waiting are a huge plus considering we usually like to dine on a budget, and the prices overall are quite reasonable. They also encourage bringing your own alcohol and will bring you glasses for whatever you bring which is great.

We ordered the vegetable egg rolls and fried rice while we waited for our rolls. The egg rolls were sadly unremarkable, good flavor but for the price of around  $4-$5 for three small rolls not really worth it but that was our only complaint and I still don't regret trying them. The fried rice on the other hand was hands down the best fried rice I've ever had. Granted I'm hispanic and don't eat fried rice terribly often but it was the kind you can't stop digging your fork into. Worth every penny.

I had ordered a Crazy Roll for myself and it was absolutely delicious. I loved that the sushi menu told you what some of the words meant so you knew what you were getting into, and their recipes and names of rolls definitely seemed unique.

I forgot what my boyfriend ordered but he loved his as well. The service was top notch, our waitress filling our cups promptly and always appearing when we needed anything as if reading our minds. It's a lovely place because I've gone a couple times now on weekend nights and it's never loud or too crowded. The atmosphere is nice as well. At the end of the meal we were given free Korean yogurt flavored soft drinks which I'd never had before but it was very good.

All in all it made our anniversary night wonderful and we will definitely going back. It's a hidden gem on the northeast side and a genuine Asian cuisine restaurant if I've ever seen one. 10/10.",1,"good"
"3","This is my 2nd time here. We were here a couple of months ago as this place was introduced to me by my 20-yr-old son who's also into Japanese food. We wanted to eat authentic home cooked Japanese food that hits the spot. We were kinda tired of the more popular Japanese places in downtown Tucson or around the university area w blaring music & noisy college
kids by the bar. Tonight, my youngest son & I were craving sushi & have finally decided to go here so a few minutes before closing time & they still greeted us very warmly. No hurrying of getting our orders or trying to make us feel like we need to hurry up eating. The miso soup is delicious! Our vegas rolls was super-crunchy & warm! My youngest son was raving about it & how much his batter-fried snapper tastes so good! My veggie yakisoba was perfectly stir-fried w the crunchiness of fresh & colorful medley of vegetables! One might say it's a bit expensive, but... really decent Japanese food, in general, isn't cheap so I could say that the gracious service & the heavenly food is well-worth the buck! Oh, and we love the extra touch of FREE probiotic drink at the end of each meal. My kids & I loved another brand of those called ""Yakult"", those are an awesome touch!",2,"good"
