"2","When I moved from Edison, NJ - I had to leave behind my favorite sushi spot, Sushi O.
It had swank decor, would never realize you're in a strip mall, the sushi was delicious, and the service was perfect.  I seriously mourned Sushi O when I left.

Until I found Hachi.

Hachi is better than my beloved Sushi O!
4.5 stars  (rounded to 5...see spicy tuna roll for the .5 off!)

I'm often in Chalfont/Doylestown now and upon craving chinese food one night, my bf and I went to the joint next to Hachi - that is when I first noticed Hachi and got very excited when I peeked inside....could it be just as good, or better? than Sushi O?  I yelped and googled Hachi hardcore, looked at all the pics and decided we must try Hachi!

Finally, this past weekend my bf and I dined here on a beautiful Sunday, early evening.
We were seated promptly, only one other couple seated not far away from our table.  Their food looked amazing - I got very excited.  

Here we go:
Environment - swanky cream neutral colors, very elegant but you don't have to be fancy pants to get through the door.  You would never believe you were in a strip mall next to a chain burger joint.  Seating was comfortable, table had good enough space for our food items, and a comfortable distance between each table.  While no one was sat next to us, if someone was - i wouldn't feel like I put my back side in their face to get out of my seat.  ha!
Service - our waitress was the sweetest, most helpful, attentive but not overly intrusive waitress I've had in a long time!  She was so pleasant, and offered suggestions when she had to unfortunately let me know they were out of otoro/didn't get any in yet for the season.  She kept our drinks filled, and table clean.  5 stars for service!
Food - 
Sakuro Steak:  seriously YUM.  Served on a scalding hot stone, teriyaki sauce poured over table side for a nice dramatic sizzle noise, this truly was a great starter.  4 bite sized pieces of steak dabbed with roasted garlic, nestled under grilled asparagus, and a grilled shishito hot pepper...I wish it was an entree..that's how much I wish there was more.
Tuna Bites:  Since they were out of otoro special, our waitress suggested the tuna bites (cause ""sounds like you like tuna!"")  girl i LOVE me some tuna and these tuna bites were bangin!  (yeah i said bangin!)  The mango salsa on top of the pistachio coated tuna chunks had just the right kick from jalapeno.  This was the one and only time I was thankful my bf doesn't eat seafood - cause I didn't want to share.
Crispy Ebi Roll:  at first I was like ehhh 11 bucks for a spiced up shrimp tempura roll...okay, I'll give it a go.  I'm glad I did, it was great and a good serving.  Two long shrimp tempura - crisp to perfection.  The sauce wasn't too sweet, just enough to elevate the taste.
Spicy tuna Roll:  I love me some spicy tuna - but I was let down by this roll unfortunately.  While it tasted good, I would not order it again.  It was cooked flake tuna cut with small chunks of plain maguro tuna.  It was disappointing to get basically a spicy tuna fish sandwich roll.  The consistency was just that, like tuna fish salad.  .5 stars off for this.  
Chicken & Steak Hibachi:  presented nicely in a shallow bowl - came with fried rice and veggies.  Ample serving of everything, the bf said it was real good - especially the fried rice being tasty.  I tried some of the veggies that he doesn't eat, and they were as he said ""real good""!
No room for dessert - the waitress seemed disappointed cause all the desserts were ""so good"" - maybe next time!

I cannot wait to go back, I have fallen in love with Hachi and look forward to trying some of the other rolls and their tuna special when the otoro is finally stocked!

Great spot for a romantic date or a place to impress someone!  Hello Valentine's Day!  Price tag on the final bill wasn't too bad considering all we ate!  Under $80 before tax and tip!  Go to Hachi now, you will not regret it!",1,"good"
"3","The best new secret in town is no longer a secret to Ivette and I. Located in the New Britain Village Square (think Blued Dog Family Tavern and Genuardi's) Hachi offers a great variety rolls, sushi and sashimi selections. The menu also includes noodles, rice and tempura.

The décor is simply beautiful... as in beautifully simple. The restaurant has been open for 2.5 months and already has a bunch of fans. The couple next to us said that they've been there ""a bunch of times already"" and everything they've had has been very good.

Make reservations before you go. You are bound to wait if you don't. We went on a whim and found ourselves walking over to the Blue Dog Tavern to wait for a table. BTW the Blue Dog has the 2014 Anchor Steam seasonal. Make sure to give it a try.

I am glad we waited rather than changing our dinner plans. 

Appetizers:
* Wakame Seaweed Salad
* Yellowtail Serrano
They were both delicious. The salad portion was big enough for Ivette and I to share. But the Yellowtail Serrano stole the opening act.  I don't recall the last time I had yellowtail that fresh. The Serrano portion of the name is what made me order. I was curious about what I thought was a fish and ham combination but... no ham in this plate. The presentation is what makes you look twice to make sure it is indeed yellowtail for it looked like a beautifully arranged pieces of thinly sliced serrano ham garnished with jalapeño and olive oil. Ivette avoids jalapeños like the plague but this time she was eating everything. This is a must-have item.

Main Dishes:
* Rainbow Roll
* Roasted Beet Avocado Roll
* Pad Thai with Fried Tofu (chicken and shrimp were other options).
The rolls were among the best we've had. All the ingredients tasted very fresh. You will definitely taste everything, specially the roasted beet... unless you make the mistake of overdoing it with the soy sauce.

Pad Tai? I was almost scraping the plate! I love rice noodles and this will be one item in their menu that will be hard for me not to order over and over.

Dessert:
* Wild Berry Toban
Mango, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, kiwi and a crunchy pie crust top served in a boiling hot covered pan. Ivette and I carved out our portions and finished it all.

Constructive comments:
Our server did a superb job serving the table. She paid a lot of attention to placement. A little more attention to keeping the table clean would have been awesome. Nothing to worry about though. I would have been nice touch.

The entrance to the kitchen is a nice-looking curtain that doesn't always close. I don't particularly care for having a view to the kitchen.

One of the owners came to our table a few times to make sure everything was to our liking. We could tell that he is genuinely interested in creating the best dining experience to his customers. As far as I am concerned he is doing that very well.

Congratulations to the Hachi folks. We look forward to our next visit.",2,"good"
"4","I was really looking forward to trying Hachi last night and was un-impressed.

The night did not start off well, we had reservations for 730, when we entered and told the hostess she looked confused then asked if we would mind sitting at the sushi bar!!  To preface this, my wife and I have two small kids and maybe go out ourselves every 2-3 months, sushi bar was not ok, and it's not like they lost our reservation, i could see our names on the list.

They got that all figured out and we sat for dinner.  For appetizer we had the sakuro steak, great presentation, but steak was too tough to eat with chop sticks, shoudl be cut smaller or use different cut of meat thats more tender.  Long hot on top was good.  We also had the sashimi salad, just ok and fish was not great.

For main course we split a bunch of sushi, overall was just ok, we have other places in the area that is much better.  Had no 7 volcano, good spice but again fish was not great, also has big island which was overspiced and fatty salmon sushi - which was tough and not ok flavor.

I hate giving bad reviews, especially for local places, but we had high expectations and they were not met.  the ambiance was nice and place has potential, but they need to step up their game.  unfortunately we don't go out much and probably will not give them another try.",1,"bad"
"5","Fantastic Hawaiian pizza and wings...umm..wait a minute. That's what I ended up eating at Gio's Pizza in Maple Glen.

I could not get noticed/served at Hachi.

Had a 7:30 sushi bar reservation. Got there 5 minutes early. Was seated right in front of the head chef.

Laid out my martini shaker, glass, sake bottle. And, then...waited.

After sitting for 15 minutes (timed), I was able to hail the hostess. She was confused but ultimately brought me ice and and bucket.

The whole while, wait staff was buzzing around me, serving the couple next to me 3 separate times.

At the 35 minute mark, the head chef finally had words with a waiter, and the waiter then asked me if I cared to order anything or if someone/anyone had taken my order.

I calmly said I had been ignored for 35 (timed) minutes, why pay attention to me now?

The head chef made a feeble attempt at explaining the situation by pointing at the numerous orders he had completed...for others.

Realizing his bad form, he quickly became quite.

I left saddened at not trying the fare. Que lastima.",2,"bad"
