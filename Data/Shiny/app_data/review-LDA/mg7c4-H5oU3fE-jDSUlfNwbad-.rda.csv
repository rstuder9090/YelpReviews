"2","Been trying to get take out from here for several weeks but had difficulty due to quarantine restrictions. Lucked out today getting my order! They were not offering delivery at the time so I do carry out, making the order was a little difficult due mainly to a lil language barrier and I think the person taking my order was a bit stressed rushing me through my order and getting card info, just seemed in a panic and stressed. Street parking was easy but probably not always, I followed instructions and called 20 minutes after placing my order, came to the door and was greeted by a table blocking the door and 3 8x10 letters explaining directions. The man came to the table with my order and set it in front of me but this guy was flexing serious PPE including a large apron, face mask, safety glasses, aaaaaaand a plastic disposable tuber wear lid strapped to his face. He set the food down and yelled some random indistinguishable directions and walked off. I assumed he forgot something so I paced in front of the door for several minutes where I got to take in the sights, smells, and experience the wonderful homeless of downtown Indy wanting money or cigarettes from me. Finally the Asian man came back with another order and started yelling at me through the door, apparently I was supposed to sign the receipt, take the food and go, I should have probably the signs while I stood there. A funny experience picking up food in Covid19 quarantine times. The star of the show was the food though! I posted pictures and everything we had was excellent. Once things blow over this will be a go to place for us, just have to expect a lil crazy placing and picking up food.",1,"good"
"3","Let me start by saying that if I wrote this review after my first 3 times eating here, I would have rated this a 2 or maybe at tops a 3 star. My only reason for visiting prior was convenience, delivery, and the guilty pleasure once every month or two of sugary americanized chinese cuisine. 

Now let me follow by saying why I ended up rating this establishment a 5 star. AUTHENTIC CHINESE MENU. I was fortunate enough to meander in and see a large table of 8 Chinese people eating dishes that I had no idea this place had, nor are readily available by normal menu. My mouth was watering. I scanned page to page of the menu without much luck of seeing anything authentically chinese. I finally asked the server about a chinese menu, and he smiled at me in a ""hell yea bro"" fashion before preceding to bring me an entirely separate menu written in mandarin with occasional English descriptions. I ordered Sichuan style twice cooked pork and a sichuan style chili chicken and the food was quite good. The quality of the chicken was better than most, as was all white meat. The spice was spot on, and felt as I was in Chinatown or even Bloomington IN where much better authenticity reigns. I left a satisfied individual, excited to return. 

To end, do not waste too much time with the americanized Chinese here, go for the gold with authentic menu. I really believe this place would thrive just going balls to the walls with their authentic menu and inter mixing the americanized options within as Indianapolis is becoming more diverse and culturally seasoned!",2,"good"
"4","Ehh... methinks not.

A group of 6 friends and I visited Asian Harbor on a weeknight for a birthday celebration and I have to admit I was pretty disappointed. Not by the food. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were huge. However, the service was a huge miss for me and unfortunately, because of that, I don't think I am likely to return. 

The restaurant was not busy. At any one time, there were not more than 3 tables (including ours) in the place. Yet the servers were still flustered and confused as if the restaurant was at capacity. 

We started with appetizers - crab rangoons and edamame. The sushi chef also made us a salad on the house with crab, avocado, ginger dressing, etc. and it was delicious! 

Then we moved on to the sushi, and boy, did our waitress struggle. Not only did she not know what was in a lot of the rolls on the menu, but also she didn't know what was in any of the rolls on the specials board. 

She also got my order wrong. I don't want to say it was intentional, but I almost feel like it was, as one of the rolls she ""thought I ordered"" was over double the cost of what I actually did order. Two of my friends' orders were wrong as well. 

When she brought my incorrect rolls, I pointed out the mistake and she went back to the sushi chef. Then, she came back with the exact same rolls that I had said were incorrect!! I said I would take these rolls since they were already made and the rest of my party was eating, but indicated I did not want to be charged for the more expensive roll as it was not my error. The server agreed I would not be charged.

When my bill arrived, what do you know, I was charged for the roll anyway! The server then played dumb and acted as though she didn't recall our conversation from several minutes prior where we agreed I would not be charged for a roll I did not order. I finally got the roll taken off my bill, but it was a struggle. 

It's disappointing that their service is so lackluster and discombobulated, because I thought the sushi and all of the food was delicious. However, the confusion and mistakes were so much so that I would rather not return. Splitting the checks was such a pain that one of my friends ended up paying for several of our meals just so we could get out of there faster - when all was said and done it was still about an 2 1/2 hour dinner. Yikes! 

I'd consider getting take out or delivery simply so I wouldn't have to interact with the staff for as long. 

I hope they can it get together for their sake and for the sake of downtown Indy, we desperately need a good Asian/sushi restaurant in the heart of the city.",1,"bad"
"5","I wanted this to be a good review.  I really did.  I ordered twice in the last week.  I received everything, as ordered, and it was well packaged.  

It's a bit annoying when the plastic lid sticks to the top of the bigger sushi rolls.  The delicious sauces and toppings stick to the lid and are removed when you lift the lid off.  It's a world-wide sushi take out hazard.

My first order was two rolls and a Tom Yum Soup.  The rolls were average, but the one that touted ""seared tuna,"" was not appetizing.  The tuna on top of the roll was heated (not seared) and kind of grey-white.  It didn't taste bad, but it looked awful.  The soup was dreadful.  It was bland and a weird color.  The veggies and shrimp inside were fresh and delicious.  The first run wasn't so bad that I didn't want to try again.  

My second order was three rolls and Tom Kai Soup.  The rolls were not awesome.  They were not rolled well and were falling apart.  This might have been due to the number of pieces crammed into a small box and the sticky rice becoming one in transit.  It tasted okay, but was a bit of a mess.  The nori was dark and very flaky, which indicates good product. 
 The Tom Kai soup was even more terrible than I could have expected.  It wasn't white and creamy, like I expected.  Also, it tasted like vomit.  I know that's a really awful thing to say and I know it wasn't vomit, but it tasted and smelled reminiscent of vomit.  I couldn't even.

This joint is off the list.",2,"bad"
