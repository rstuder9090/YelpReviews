"2","I did a to-go order right before 3PM, so they honored the lunch pricing. 
I ordered the shrimp pad Thai with egg roll (versus the salad option) and a Thai iced tea. 
I love Thai iced tea & this one hit the spot with the flavor & sweetness. 
The side egg roll wasn't anything special, but the dipping sauce (think similar to a sweet chili / sweet n sour) made up for what it was lacking. 
The shrimp pad Thai was fresh tasting & a good portion for the price. About 5 average size shrimp mixed in with the pad Thai noodles & other ingredients. 
I paid just over $12 for the meal & drink. 
Friendly, fast & efficient. I'll be back!",1,"good"
"3","EASILY 5 STARS for OUTSTANDING Thai food; a HUGE variety of foods offered; LOWER than average pricing; & EXCELLENT service. This locally-owned restaurant has been open ten years. Open seven days weekly, its hours are all over the place (& sometimes split), so check before you make the drive.  

This is a restaurant whose dining area is essentially three separate rooms. There are tables, but also very comfort  booths-- see pics. The interior was clean & organized. Potted orchids are on display & for sale-- see pic. 

The menu is B---I---G. We decided to sample two appetizers, two entrees, & one desserts. We also took home Crab Meat Soup ($4.95) & Kimchi ($6 for 24 oz). EVERYTHING WAS SPOT ON IN FLAVOR! The food pics speak volumes-- the Beef Pad Thai @ $10.95 was flavorful w/ the noodles cooked perfectly. The Tofu Bamee @ $10.95 was very good-- the Tofu & veggies so tender. The Spring Rolls @ $5.95 were the BEST either of us had ever had anywhere, & the Curry Puff @ $7.95, w/ its delicate flakey crust, was great. Both appetizers were accompanied by a delicious dipping sauce. The Kimchi was perfectly seasoned, & the Crab Meat Soup w/ its light broth, fresh veggies & fresh Crab was phenomenal. We shared the lightly sweetened Banana Coins @ $3.95-- so good! Who can resist fresh banana slices wrapped in wheat paper then deep fried & drizzled w/ honey. Yummy:)

The friendly, knowledgeable older woman who waited on us was an excellent server-- we couldn't have received better service. She quickly boxed & bagged our leftovers for us.

With PRICES SO REASONABLE & everything we ate simply DELICIOUS, I look forward to returning to try other offerings such as the Garlic & Black Pepper entree; the Panang Curry; the Chicken Satay; the Tom Kha Shrimp Soup; & the Mango & Sticky Rice dessert. I can only imagine how well those dishes are prepared @ this FANTASTIC Thai eatery!",2,"good"
