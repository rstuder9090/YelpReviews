A bit expensive.

Those were the words running through my head when I took a look at their menu for the first time. They have no website (yet?) and there does not seem to be an online menu anywhere (crap, I should have taken photos with my crappy iPhone camera and uploaded them here! rats! I love how my good ideas come hours AFTER I leave a place, lol) ...... so naturally I had no clue if it would be expensive or not. It's located in a sort of shopping plaza type of thing, so it makes you think it's going to look sorta ghetto, but the inside is very nicely decorated....it tries to be traditional yet hip at the same time, and I think it all goes together quite nicely (unlike the Drunken Fish which seems to be trying too hard to be some type of weird fusion lounge thingy.)

So anyway... I have one gripe to start off with. On Yelp it says the joint opens around 11am and stays open till about 10pm on a day like today (Tuesday afternoon.) But when I arrived, a sign on the front said ""closed for lunch break 2:00pm - 4:30pm.) WTF? I was kinda pissed. Thankfully it was already 3:30pm and there was a Starbucks right next door. (Probably the best Starbucks I've ever been to in my entire life, so maybe that was a blessing in disguise. More on that in a seperate review, ha.) I sat at SBux for a while until the restaurant opened, giving me ample time to catch up on the phone with my mum. (Hi Mum!) I wish they had a website that mentioned said lunch break. Thankfully I was in the area already for a doc visit, otherwise I doubt I'd have made the pilgrimage so far just for sushi... :P (Although after my craptastic experience at Sekisui, I had to come try Kenji's new restaurant for a sort of sushi de-tox so to speak.)

Finally, the sacred hour of 4:30pm struck'eth and I hopped on over to Izakaya. I've never heard of the term ""izakaya"" before not even when I lived in Japan, so yeah...dunno what that says about my cultural experiences or if I was just sheltered whilst living over there or what.... but it's sort of like a  quote ""tapas""/small plates type of establishment. Probably like a place to grab a quick bite during lunch hour at work, except that it was anything but quick service. Really now, how long does it take to make four sushi nigiri (not even rolls with all of the crazy ingredients in them!) plus one appetizer? Jeez. I was also the ONLY person in the entire restaurant! The waitress, bless her, was not very knowledgeable about anything. Everytime I had a question about the menu she just scratched her head and went over to the owner/manager/whoever and reiterated my question to them verbatum and really loudly at that... Awkward. Maybe they're still trying to hire/train waitstaff....and plus it was a weird dining hour, so maybe that's why? IDK.... I'd prefer waitstaff to actually know what a quail egg is, though. Also gonna second the comment another reviewer left about the waitstaff entering through the front door for shift changes. Kinda unprofessional. A gal was entering for her shift just as I was leaving.

So it seems like I am bitching a lot in this review, and you'd wonder why--for me giving them a 4/5 star rating. Well I loved the atmosphere, the music (omg Jpop?! in my izakayas?!), the fact that it's in  such a random location (read: not CWE) and yet still manages to stay in business (for now...) plus the food is very good quality. It's just kinda overpriced for what I came in for. I am sure if I had ordered just appetizers/small plates, it would have been fine but I managed to blow $34 for JUST myself on: sea urchin, sweet shrimp, salmon roe + quail egg, tuna, hot green tea, plus one order of the Ren spring rolls. + a tip. Jesus. $34 could have purchased me a whole fragging tray of pretty tastily-good sea urchin from Bob's Seafood. I guess I was expecting the former (good) quality of fish that Sekisui used to have + the same price. Wrong-o. I mean $9 for a tiny little piece of uni? =__=;; It was tasty, though, I must admit, but not the best uni I'd ever tasted, either. A notch above the half-frozen abomination had at Sekisui's but not uni nirvana either, lol. 

But no worries, I still adore this little restaurant, and I will probably be back at the end of this month when I go to Des Peres hospital again for another doc appointment. After all, it's only 5 minutes away on Dougherty Ferry Rd. Plus I wanna go back to the Starbucks in the same plaza. The service and food was exceptional and I can't believe I'm writing that about a freaking Sbux. lol. 

Sorry for such a rambly review but I guess I had a bone to pick with them....they weren't getting off on tasty cuisine alone...I shall be back, though! Hopefully by then, the owners will step it up a notch! 

(Oh and I usually try to remark about the bathrooms but I didn't have the desire to go check it out this time...or the urge!!) :D",1,"good"
"3","... so we're the type of people who will drive far out for cuz some chef moved out West.  We did this for the I *heart* Mr. Sushi guy (Yoshi's) and now we've done it for Kenji, formerly of Sekisui on Grand.... but actually, Izakaya Ren is abooout the same distance, so it's ok.

I have to say it was worth it.  We came on a slow Sunday (they juuuust opened what, 2 weeks ago?) to a strip mall and walked inside to see a pretty small eating establishment... which made us wonder about their customer turnover rate.  We just ordered all over, from the skewers, a chop chae salad (Kenji and this Korean guy, Wokrae Cho are co-owners?), grilled fish neck, and sushi.

They were all delicious.

In particular, I liked the pork belly wrapped asparagus skewer.  It wasn't seasoned, making me think of sam gap sal.  It was gosh darned tasty.  

The chop chae salad was potato glass noodles with greens and a spicy chili oil vinaigrette thing that was pretty good.  

The sushi.  This is what we really came for.  The fish was about room temperature and was just melt-in-your mouth quality.  You know how hard it is to find a place that has a decent yellowtail roll with green onion?!  It's absurd.  I really hope they hold their standards to this high a bar.

Finally, the hamachi kama was fresh, moist, and delicious.  It wasn't pre-cured or anything, though.  It was just plain simple fresh fish neck that sat on the grill undisturbed.  

The only gripe I had was that the skewers were pretty expensive for their size, which averaged a bit over 2 bucks apiece.  I don't know if they have a happy hour, but I will likely steer clear of that part of the menu otherwise.  We found ourselves easily dropping more than 20 bucks a person for this place, but that was simply because we felt the need to try ALL our staples.

All in all, we will definitely be coming back again.  If you like plain old fashioned Japanese food with a little mix of Korean, this is the place to try.",2,"good"
