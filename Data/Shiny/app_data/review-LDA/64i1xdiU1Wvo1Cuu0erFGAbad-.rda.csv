"2","If you're looking for an affordable and filling sushi spot, Megu is a Japanese restaurant located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the Village Walk Shopping Center. Also, it is BYOB and does not charge a corking fee. 

As you walk through the doors of Megu, you're immediately greeted by a server or one of the owners, a husband and wife duo, who promptly asks if you would like to be seated at the sushi bar, regular seating or if you have come for the hibachi. The interior is split into five different sections. However, don't let the many sections fool you into thinking the restaurant is enormous, Megu provides a close atmosphere. If you're looking for a visually stimulating experience as well, the walls are vibrant with splashes of purple, orange and golden yellow. 

My friend and I opted for the booth seating and started to browse through the menu. The menu is extensive and offers traditional Japanese fare such as sushi a la carte, sashimi a la carte, hand and maki rolls, specialty rolls, and cooked kitchen entrees. Before ordering, a complimentary appetizer of cold, sliced cucumbers in a tangy, and slightly spicy, vinaigrette sauce is placed on the table along with hot towels to clean your hands. The cucumbers were crisp, fresh and the red chili flakes added to the sauce nicely complimented the sweetness of the cucumbers. As the waitress cleared our table, my friend and I decided to order the tuna dumpling appetizer ($10), salmon sashimi ($5) and avocado salad ($4). As we were waiting for our food, our waitress was friendly and easy to smile as she refilled our glasses. 

The tuna dumpling appetizer, salmon sashimi and avocado salad arrived in unison. A quick note, the tuna dumplings are not dumplings in the traditional sense, because they're not made with wonton skins or even fried, but slices of raw tuna are wrapped around cooked crab filling and placed on a plate atop of a thick, brown sauce. Three bite-sized dumplings and the freshness of the tuna and sweet crab meat are accented by the salty, soy-sauce. My friend and I were also delighted with the three, thick slices of salmon sashimi, which literally melted in our mouths. Unfortunately, the avocado salad was average and we decided to order some specialty rolls. 

Still not feeling full after finishing the three appetizers, we moved onto the main course and ordered the Godzilla roll ($9.95), Megu roll ($11.95) and Volcano roll ($9.95). The rolls came promptly, and my friend and I eagerly poured soy sauce and swirled bright green wasabi into our individual sauce holders. We started with the Megu roll first, and being named after the restaurant, we had high expectations. The Megu roll had pieces of juicy lobster on top of the rice, another reason why we had chosen this roll, and crispy tempura battered shrimp, cucumber, imitation crab, and avocado inside. The combination of the succulent lobster with the crunchy batter and creaminess of the avocado pieces caused my friend and I to stop mid-chew and enjoy the mixture of textures and flavors. 

Next, we moved on to the Godzilla roll, which is a battered and quickly deep fried roll. The inside is a combination of spicy salmon and tuna and avocado, and the roll is topped with different colored caviar. The caviar that's used to top the roll is a mixture of red, green and black fish roe, and the color contrast is beautiful against the lightly fried batter. The Volcano roll was a simple roll, despite its place in the specialty listing, and was a combination of spicy tuna, avocado and crunch pieces of panko crumbs. All rolls are similar in portion and come with six to eight pieces. 

Unfortunately, after finishing the three rolls, my friend and I were sadly too full for dessert. The menu offers classic Japanese restaurant staples such as green tea tempura ice cream ($6) and patisserie options like tiramisu and mango mousse ($6). 

Between my friend and I, our bill amounted to a little over $50 before tax and tip were included. Megu is a budget friendly restaurant and on offers special deals on Sundays and Mondays where all a la carte sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are 30 percent off. Weekends are a busy time for this cozy restaurant and reservations are advised.",1,"good"
"3","No, I'm not a mathematician, but this summer I have formulated a game changing equation: #squad + wine + sushi= everything's gucci. I can honestly say up to about a year ago; I was not the biggest fan of Japan's most famous culinary contribution to western civilization. That was until, a friend of mine, introduced me to a tempura shrimp and spicy crab roll that pretty much made my perception do a 180.

Ever since then I have been hooked, no pun intended, on the raw fish phenomena. I feel as if I eat it once, maybe twice a week. I should have wasabi, shrimp, ginger, yellowtail, and Shoyu Ramen pouring out of my every orifice based on how much Asian cuisine I consume. Needless to say, I found myself with #squad at Megu Modern Japanese Cuisine ready to go in on a Labor Day sushi smash.  

Megu has three locations (Moorestown, Cherry Hill, and Ventnor City) so if you enjoy Japanese and haven't been to one of their restaurants; you have done yourself quite a disservice. We chose Moorestown and opted for the gorgeous patio seating. Sunday's and Monday's are 30% off special rolls, and if you're balling on a budget like me than this is more life fo ya head top(excuse my Jamaican patois it comes out randomly after listening to Drake). We put in our order poured up some vino and before we knew it our feast was in front of us. 

Altogether we got some shrimp shumai, a spicy yellow tail hand roll, Summer roll, Volcano roll, and a Megu roll. The shumai was steamed and delicious not much different from any other steamed version I've had, so they didn't lose or gain any points with that. The Summer roll was filled with spicy tuna and cucumber topped with mango sauce. The Volcano roll contained spicy crunchy tuna and avocado with a hot spicy sauce. They were both delicious the sweet mango sauce and spicy tuna paired perfectly, and didn't last very long on the plate.
The spicy yellowtail hand roll filled with cucumber and rice was pretty good. I only say pretty good because I'm not a hand roll guy. I tried it I liked it and I wasn't disappointed. That's definitely a win for Megu. Let's get to what I really came here for though, the Megu Roll. I'm guessing it's their signature roll since it carries their namesake. It was my version of the perfect roll; shrimp tempura and crab on the inside, and delicious lobster meat perched on top. I dumped all my wasabi in the soy and prepared myself for this palatable dream bite. It was crunchy, spicy, salty, sweet, basically everything your body craves all in one. img_0649

Empty wine bottles and barren plates were a sign that my work here is done. Megu hit me with some trill rolls and I can't think of better way to spend a Sunday-out-of-football-season afternoon. This day was straight out of an Ice Cube song. "" Drunk as hell but no throwing up, halfway home and my iPhone still blowing up, today I didn't even have to eat no Pei Wei, I gotta say it was a good day""",2,"good"
"4","While Megu has good sushi for good prices (when you go on their discount sushi days), we recently had a less-than-pleasant experience when we tried to go for lunch on Sunday (12/24).

Because it was Sunday, we were expecting to receive their normal discount sushi menu, and when we were seated we had to ask the waitress to get us the correct menus.  She walked away from the table, and we naturally assumed she was going to get them.  When she returned she said, ""It's a holiday, we don't offer discounts today.""

There are at least 2 things wrong with how this exchange occurred.  First, why didn't the waitress know they weren't following their normal protocol for sushi on Sundays?  Apparently someone made up this new rule, and never got around to telling the waitstaff.

Secondly, I would loosely call noon on Christmas Eve a 'holiday'.  If I have to be technical about it, Christmas Eve is actually the day before the holiday, hence 'Eve'.  More importantly, the way in which the waitress expressed that it was a holiday was far too general since not everyone celebrates Christmas.  What if we decided to go during Kwanzaa or Rosh Hashanah or Veterans Day?  I am sure they offer their normal sushi discounts during those holidays, so why was the day before a holiday any different?

Instead of saying, ""We usually do not offer the discounts around the holidays, but we can make this exception since you are already seated and ready to order."" she just let us get up and walk out of the restaurant, leaving not a single patron there for lunch.  Instead of giving a small discount that you would give on any other Sunday, you just lost the entire bill.

Apparently they were expecting a lot of patrons at some point during the day, all of whom were undeserving of that savings.  They could have used the opportunity to relay the message to all of those patrons that they have discount sushi days, and could have had more loyal customers for future dates, rather than turning them away.",1,"bad"
"5","Bad Experience - Initially, we sat outdoors - nice setting.  Never received service although we alerted management that we were sitting outside.  Received menus but sat outside for over 20 minutes and never saw a waiter or waitress.  Wife walked inside to ask if someone would take our order.  Waitress appeared, took our order, and then, 10 minutes later a manager appeared and requested that we please go indoors - that they did not have enough servers to serve us outside!  We then collected all our drinks (wine and water glasses) and shifted indoors.  One of our side orders - prior to the sushi we ordered - was hibachi rice.  We requested that extra onions and scallions be put into the rice during cooking to assist with added seasoning.  The rice arrived 15 minutes later - was not hot; was stuck together (not fresh at all).  We called the waitress over and informed her of the problem with the rice.  She took it off the table and asked if we would like something else.  We responded ""no - please just make the rice fresh for us"" as was initially ordered.  We received the rice when we received our sushi order which was fine.  However, the rice was minimally seasoned and had NO onions and NO scallions in it.  We made no mention of this and proceeded to eat it along with our sushi rolls. When we received our bill the rice was overcharged by $2.  Believe me, it is not the $2. I was upset about but rather the principal involved.  This, after having cold rice initially and the 2nd time - no seasoning.  I informed the waitress who proceeded to send over the manager who refused to adjust the bill.  We payed the amount requested BUT have no intention of ever returning to this establishment.  Their are plenty of other sushi restaurants in the Cherry Hill area and we will frequent them in the future.  Megu has lost our business and we have every intention of sharing our  negative experience with friends and family.",2,"bad"
