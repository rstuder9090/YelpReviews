"2","I started a sushi club with friends 2 years ago that we try one BYOB sushi restaurant in the area one Thursday a month. This was to be the last one I organize. Our club has grown so we generally have 15-20 people.  We originally picked Kumo at Collegeville where we had 23 people doing family style and was floored by the sushi but they don't take big group Thursday-Sunday now. I made reservation for 16 on Tuesday at Ooka for 7:30 on a Friday and was told they could only do 8:30 with a group our size. I called on Thursday to add 2 more people and was told they can't guarantee we would be seated by 8:30 and that 9:00 would be better because it's a Friday. By then I was getting apprehended that this would be quite a hassle with long waits and delays.

We were very pleasantly surprised!!! Not only were we promptly seated at 8:30, the service was so exceptional and speedy. Based on our experience with other sushi places, we ordered edamame thinking it would hold us over till sushi comes. And food came out so fast edamame was left uneaten!

My new favorite Roll that I didn't try previous time was Shrimp and Baked Sea Scallops Roll. It is dynamite! Our favs from previous were AAA Roll and James Bond. Hubby likes Lobster Dynamite Roll too! I didn't care for the Spicy Scallop Tempura Roll last time and even less so this time. It depends on which piece you happen to eat. The pieces that have more avocado and less eels taste better. Eels could be pretty overpowering. We tried other rolls from someone else's plates. These were all good but not necessarily as memorable: Hot Spicy Roll, Purple Roll, Ooka Roll. 

A few of us also opted for hibachi. It was very entertaining! 

Now up to my favorite thing of this restaurant, Desserts!!! They have hands down the best desserts of all sushi restaurants we tried. I don't normally care for sweets but I had two desserts both times I was there. I had my fav from last time the Ruby Poached Japanese Pear and a new one Garden in a Glass, yummy mixture of Panna Cotta and strawberry pur√©e with Chocolate 'dirt'. Heavenly!

I was very happy this was where we had our final sushi club dinner! Great food and great service!!!",1,"good"
"3","A FABULOUS night out at Ookas.  Service (Ann) was spectacular, our meals both picturesque platings and so incredibly fresh and what awesome textures and the flavor far exceeded expectations.

Doesn't get better than at Ookas, you just have to know what you like and how to order; rely on your server for assistance as that is one of the key reasons they are there.

After discussing the night's specials and reviewing the menu we spoke with Ann to get her take on how we wanted to structure our meal. For this visit we opted to stick with appetizers and rolls which we shared; hence no entree.  In the end, it was a perfect selection, ordering, and experience.

Now to get your mouth watering.... for our first course, we started with the tuna bites ---  roasted pistachio, spicy tuna bite with mango salsa.  Definitely something different and boy the plating presentation was spectacular. What a great flavor coaster.... you taste the crushed pistachios, followed by the tuna and on the back end you get a little kick from the mango salsa.  Satisfying to the palette. 

For our second course, my wife had the lobster bun- Boston fresh Maine lobster with house cream sauce served in a split bun and wrapped in Boston lettuce all served in a martini glass.  Very pretty presentation and tasty too. 

I had the grilled octopus and I must say, this was one of the top 2 octopus dishes I've ever had and I seek it out high and low; hands down this recipe delivers a wonderful combination of flavors.  Grilled octopus tentacles served over a bed of salad greens with halved cherry tomatoes in a pomegranate reduction that was to die for. 

For our third course, we shared the Earth/Sea Roll- a special roll, (couldn't find on their online menus so I'll do my best to describe) outside is perfectly cooked filet mignon wrapped around the rice exterior of the roll which was filled with mango, cucumber, topped with roe, (I'm embarrassed that I can't recall the fish in the roll) with white truffle sprinkled on the plate.  This roll delivers a festival of flavors and textures.

Can't say excellent experience enough times.",2,"good"
