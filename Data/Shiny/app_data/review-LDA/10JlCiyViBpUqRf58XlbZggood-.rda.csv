Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.

Last night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. 

Not to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!

Enjoy!!",1,"good"
"3","We stopped into Pasta Vino for lunch on a whim and it was great!

While the desolate, decaying and shuttered former strip mall across from the entrance is not inviting; look past it and go into the much more inviting interior of Pasta Vino.

Jane, our server, seated us immediately and we smiled at her enthusiasm and personality.

We ordered Pasta Puttanesca and Pasta Carbonara.  The accompanying salad was fresh and good, and my gazpacho was delicious.  Cool, creamy, studded with tomatoes and cucumbers with a perfect touch of spice and drizzle of olive oil.  A small bread basket accompanied our meal and the breads were warm, soft and tasty.

The pastas came hot, al dente and beautifully dressed with their respective, perfectly executed sauces - delicious.  The Puttanesca was redolent of all the elements: a hint of anchovy, olives, tomatoes and my Carbonara was creamy, unctuous and filled with peas and bacon.

I ended with coffee and a fantastic pistachio gelato suggested by Jane.

We will definitely be back to Pasta Vino.",2,"good"
