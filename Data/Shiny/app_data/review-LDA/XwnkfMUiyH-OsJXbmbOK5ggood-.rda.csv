"2","I've been to Sachi on Chapala and Kai on State Street, but didn't realize there was a sushi place inside Paseo Nuevo until pretty much now. Came in with Japanese comfort food in mind, but left with an order of rolls as well.

Tempura Udon - Love how the soup was packaged in a separate container, Sushi Ai in Goleta did not do the same for my takeout recently, and it was a soggy mess. Thank you thank you thank you. The udon by itself isn't expensive, but the toppings are an easy $3-4 extra. Options include Chicken, Gyoza, Pork Belly, Seafood, or Steak. The Mixed Tempura was a good choice, the vegetables were fried nicely and the shrimp was tasty. Wish they just had a simple beef udon.

Chicken Teriyaki Bento - This was a feast. Sweet glazed slices of chicken laying on a bed of rice, with a side salad and an orange slice to go along with it. It also comes with six California rolls, two fried gyozas, and a (potato? sorry I forgot) croquette. Very filling compared to the soups, and more variety compared to the rice bowls. For additional $$, you can have an extra serving of beef, chicken, or tempura.

Sweet Crunch Shrimp Roll - premium version of the Shrimp Tempura Roll essentially. Very similar ingredients: shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, avocado, sweet soy. Not too sure if it was worth it, I might've just gone with the regular one instead.
Small interior with only space for a few to socially distance. Outside area is nice to sit on warm days, with umbrellas providing shade.",1,"good"
"3","That's probably the cheapest Japanese food you can find in Santa Barbara that serves decent food.

I often eat there whenever I need to grab something to eat while shopping in paseo. Their rolls tastes good, as well as their chicken curry bowl, my favorite.

The lady at the counter is very nice and always smiling, even though she doesn't speak English that well she'll do everything to get your order right. However, once served, there is no ""waiter"" present, since the restaurant is very small, it's more of a to-go / take out kind of place vibe so don't expect a refill on your water!

Side note: Don't drink the tap water they have, I believe they just pour unfiltered tap water into the water fountain.",2,"good"
