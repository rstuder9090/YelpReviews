I came at lunch time at 2 pm on a Friday. This place is located in a strip mall right next to the movie theater. The decorum has a modern Asian vibe to it. I dig it.

They don't have sushi lunch specials so I opted to try out a Thai dish. I got the garlic sauce with shrimp. It comes with your choice of soup or salad. I got the miso soup and it was legit. The taste wasn't too overpowering at all. Solid.

The food came out before I was done with the soup. But that's probably cuz it's dead. Very generous portion size. Sid large shrimps. Big mound of white rice. If you're expecting the more saucier type of Thai food, this is not like that. It's very flavorful for sure. I got medium spice on it because some Thai spice levels can be off the chart. For me it was still real mild so take that how you will. Full disclaimer: I was tanning in the uterus so I am used to spice.

My waitress is what made the experience. She was incredibly helpful (as it was my first time), pleasant, always smiling, she checked on me just the right amount of times, and she never let my glass get fully empty. She's the server that people dream of.

Food is a solid 4 but the service has me giving this place a 5/5. Looking forward to them adding a sushi lunch special.",1,"good"

There was no one but we were treated like gods, the sushi was amazing super filled light rice and top with just the  Most fresh fish I could have wanted all of our special request were honored as re customer service was their priority. I highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone as they have a wide range of Thai and sushi options and a ton of roles go get one!",2,"good"
