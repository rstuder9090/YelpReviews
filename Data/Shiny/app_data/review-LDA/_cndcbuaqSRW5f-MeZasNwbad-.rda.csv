"2","I've had a hankering for hibachi for the longest time now and the other day I randomly found this place and decided to give it a try. Inside is a fairly sized restaurant with some bar seating, a few regular tables, and plenty of hibachi tables. My BF and I opted to sit at a regular table but ordered the hibachi dinners. The hibachi dinners cost around $20 and come with the standard house salad/ginger dressing, miso soup, and also ice cream (although we didn't want our ice cream). I love ginger dressing and theirs does not disappoint. Their ginger dressing is oddly cream colored and pretty liquidy but still tastes absolutely delicious. Their miso soup is basic but tasty. The hibachi dinner came out really quickly since we sat at a regular table, and we asked for yum yum sauce. Food was as expected, nothing mind blowing but will absolutely hit the spot for a hibachi craving. My BF and I both got steak for our proteins, asked for medium rare, and neither of our steaks came out too overdone (though probably more like medium than medium rare). I like a lot of veggies and thought there could've been slightly more veggies, but that's just being nit picky. There was definitely a good portion of the protein and overall serving size is good! If I were in the area again, I wouldn't mind coming back!",1,"good"
"3","We (me + wife) initially started coming here as a friend has his birthday almost every year.  The performance cooking is sure to please anyone who has never seen it, and even those who have seen it a few times like myself.

Our last visit here was on a Tuesday late October celebrating a friend of ours winning 3 Best of Nashville awards, and we came for some reason without a reservation (I believe due to too many ""maybes"" on the invite - don't know why really, I was not the planner).

I did not expect to be seated at a grill, but was pleasantly surprised when we got there that they had more than enough space for us.  They were quite accommodating as chunks of our group could not make it on time and people had to leave before eating (too many things going on).  The waitstaff seemed to be running at exactly the right speed that night.

When the majority of our party was gathered, the chef (Chad) came out, did a show that involved using spatulas to play something that resembled the music that started nearly every 1970's Kung Fu movie.  It was a cacophony of audio embellishment I had not expected or experienced before.

He juggled eggs, made a flaming onion volcano, things went flying everywhere but not a single rice grain made it past the grill toward us.  The performance had the air of a professional who has done it so many times that he could be doing advanced calculus in his head and not skip a beat.

He prepared the vegetarian orders first so as to not slather the tofu in meat juices.  He asked a bit about what defines a vegetarian / vegetarian food prep standards and the veggies there each had different answers with the consensus being prepping the tofu first would probably please most of the veggie world but that the vegans would probably be pissed that it was prepped on a grill post-egg.

My meal was good, not excellent, but near the really good side of good.  My compatriots were all happy with theirs.  I was entertained and it did not break the bank.  The people at the restaurant were nice, attentive.  I find it odd that I have not found something to dislike there in multiple visits.

The place is located 4 feet from where the front door to the old Nipper's Corner theater was if I'm not mistaken.  It's right next to a Jet's pizza, and slightly to the right of Publix if you're looking straight at it.  Parking is easy, the lot is well lit, and the only thing to watch out for is the dedicated Jet's Pizza delivery drivers (who appear to take great pains to not kill anyone)",2,"good"
"4","If I could put negative stars I would! This place is utterly ridiculous. We just left about an hour ago for the following reasons:
1) Place is old: menus are falling apart and ranges are gross. If you're charging about $20/plate or more you can afford to get your ranges cleaned. I mean come on...
2) Salad has thousand island dressing and looks like the salad you can get from Costco in a big bag for under $2 we've been to a ton of Tepanyaki Grills and salad should be served with ginger dressing -I tried it and fiancé refused to eat it... What a waste
3) Onion mushroom soup is a joke... It tastes like cup of noodles soup with a few pieces of green onion and 2 pieces of mushroom... Gross... Another waste...

What did it for us was the service. Not by our waitress but by the owner! There was one couple seated to our right and then there was the two of us. Another couple came with their baby and the owner came to our table to seat them and ""shoo-ed"" my fiancé to move. Then he sat a larger group across from us and was pointing at a person and pointing at the chair for them to sit... How rude! And he was frowning the whole time! After this, my fiancé was fuming... If you're not grateful for your customers then you don't deserve any business.

We asked for our check and the waitress brought it and asked what was wrong but my fiancé didn't want to deal with the owner. They charged us $15.27 for two sweet teas we didn't drink, 1 untouched salad, 1 half eaten salad and 2 untouched soups. If you owned a restaurant and $70-100 ticket is about to walk out the door, wouldn't you go and try to fix the problem? We know our waitress told the owner because we saw her go up to him and he just walked off.


DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND EAT HERE!

We just finished eating at another Steakhouse and got much better service and food was so much better.",1,"bad"
"5","My friend and I are frequent diners at restaurants in the Middle Tennessee area, so there are very little places that we have not been before. On this particular night, we wanted hibachi, so we chose the closest one to our location via Google. Unfortunately for us, this selection was one of the worst choices we could have picked. Upon arriving there, we were sat at a very crowded hibachi station with a family of five not including their infant child. We were extremely uncomfortable, so we asked if we could be served hibachi at a traditional table. Our server obliged, and we proceeded to move to the new table.
 Once seated, we waited an exceptionally long time for our waiter to come and take our drink orders. About fifteen minutes passed until we were given our sodas which were watery at the point. Despite this, we still did not complain, we just sipped our watered down drinks until our waiter reappeared ten minutes later to take our food order. I ordered the hibachi steak, and my friend ordered hibachi chicken. While we waited, we were not given any refills or asked if we needed anything. 
We sat for about twenty minutes until our food was served. As we bit into the food, we quickly realized the food was cold. It felt and tasted like it was food that was previously frozen, but had not fully been thawed out, but was thrown on the grill. As a result of this, I flagged down who I thought was the manager, but in turn, he was the owner. He shouted an incomprehensible message in another language to our server and took our plates to the back with no explanation as to what he was doing. 
A few minutes later our plates return with the same food only now it was charred. I asked to speak to him again, and when he returned I started to state my displeasure for the food and service we had been given, and he promptly picked up our plates and told us to get out! In a confused disbelief I asked him to repeat himself. He then said ""You no like our food, there's door"". I said excuse me, but I have never been treated in this manner in the 25+ years I have dined in restaurant establishments. 
As my friend and I gathered our things the owner and his staff refused to tell me his name. I told him that I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this ridiculous experience. I am highly dissatisfied, and I will never return to this restaurant. I hope many are deterred from dining there as well since this is the treatment they give to patrons. Giving this restaurant ONE star is even too kind for the treatment we received!",2,"bad"
