"2","This is a good sushi place but Hiroba Sushi is still my favorite.
At first I was going to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, since some of what they're doing at Ricksaw Sushi Kwon does at Hiroba: Gravlax, appetizers included with all you can eat, cucumbers along with ginger to cleanse the palate and a few other things.
Then I remembered that Kwon was hired to turn the original Rickshaw at Kietzke and South Virginia from a Chinese food place to a sushi place, so I'm not sure how much may be left from his time working there.
One nice addition to the appetizers at Rickshaw I don't remember seeing any place else is a small salad. I think it comes with a sesame dressing. You eat it with chopsticks.
The mussels are spicier at Rickshaw sushi, which I also liked.
I ordered unagi to start because it's kind of a litmus test dish. If it's old it tastes fishy and their unagi was fresh and delicious. The tamago, or scrambled egg, wasn't that good and may have been old. it was kind of a stumble.
Also I had to try their Gravlax, since I love this at Hiroba. I didn't like their as much as Hiroba's gravlax. I usually get a reorder at Hiroba but I passed at Rickshaw.
Next came the upside down shrimp and this was excellent. The seared maguro was kind of a stumble, though. I didn't like the flavor.
Next came the Lulu roll and this was probably my favorite sushi of the meal. Lots of great flavors. I decided to try the shrimp balls appetizer and it was okay. It didn't seem to be the best quality shrimp.  I tried a crab (kani) to finish and it was bland.
For dessert, the sushi chef made me something out of an orange that was a beautiful presentation and also quite delicious.
Overall the meal was good and I have no problem going to Rickshaw sushi again.
The original restaurant was called Rickshaw Paddy's or something like that and it opened in the 1990s. The owner, Rick Shaw, had traveled in Asia and he offered pan-Asian cuisine, including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai and I think there was an Asian Indian dish on the menu. He was also of Irish descent so he also offered corned beef and cabbage and boiled potatoes. As I recall the logo was of a leprechaun pulling a rickshaw.
The food was so so. The restaurant did better with the Japanese and Chinese dishes. The pud thai was bad and the Korean short ribs were heavily drenched in soy sauce, not the sauce you typically see on Korean food. I think they were prepared as Japanese ribs and then slightly altered and called Korean.
Rick Shaw sold the restaurant and a subsequent owner changed it to Chinese only food. I tried it once and I've got to say it was a contender for one of the 10 worst restaurants in Reno. I got a chicken dish and the meat was not identified as chicken or anything other than some sort of protein substance. I felt like I needed a tetanus shot after eating there.
The owner eventually brought in Kwon, remodeled it into a sushi restaurant and that's when I met Kwon. I think he left after about a year to start Hiroba Sushi.
This new location of Rickshaw Sushi is doing well. The owners have gotten a talented staff and they're buying good quality fish. I hope Reno rewards them with financial success.",1,"good"
"3","This place is definitely my new favorite sushi spot in Reno. 

The lowdown;

Fish; Good quality, fresh (it is noticeably better than many other spots in Reno)

Rolls; Great selection of long rolls, nigiri, hand rolls. They do use quite a bit of sauce (and sesame seeds which a friend of mine did not care for) so if that isn't your thing, I would ask for light or none. 

They do a good job to accommodate requests such as additions or subtractions to rolls at no extra cost. They seem to always have an awesome special roll of the day. Free bottle of sake on Saturday.

Atmosphere; This place is off the beaten track and doesn't get any tourist traffic so it stays relatively quiet. It might get busy but I have never seen it. 

It's always a little weird (in a good way I think) as they don't really put music on. They do have TV's but last time I was there, they were watching some bad WWII movie where Americans were battling Japanese (which is a bit strange for a restaurant, no less a Japanese restaurant). Maybe it's just me, I thought it was funny. 

The chefs are really friendly but do not speak the best English.

The lunch price is the best deal as you get about 90% of the rolls on the menu for 60% of the dinner price.

All in all, I love it. Great food, great price for AYCE, and you always leave really full.",2,"good"
"4","We have driven by here several times before we tried it out.

First off be warned.... (I blew it) this is (best as I can tell) no relation to Rickshaws fine Asian bistro on Virginia st. This is a second hand rip off and they should be ashamed to play on the name as if they were one in the same. It's not even the same game let alone in the same ballpark. It's like paying for game 7 of the World Series, then arriving to find it's the spring training equivalent to midget arm wrestling (and don't get me wrong that has a place) it's just not game 7 and you figure it out once you arrive,  I mean you know your at the wrong place but you were expecting entertainment and your not getting game 7 so you just stay. Then you hate yourself for weeks afterwards. That was this experience. 

In a word.... blah....dirty, poorly ran, food was average at best. Some items fair and some sucked. 

We were the only ones in there and the girl cook was watching ""people's court"" over our shoulder, arms folded and more pissed that she was there than I was. I think she expected game 7 as well. She wasn't just a cook with a bad attitude, she was pissed at something.

Trash everywhere and they use the restaurant to store toilet paper and paper towels.  (By the bathroom) take a look at the ""bathroom sign"" (if your already here and can't escape) they used so much glue to secure it that the glue is oozing out the bottom and running down the wall. (Just another poor example of how clean it's not)
If the stuff I can see is this dirty then how does stuff I can't see look. Yikes!!!

Overall this was a BAD experience and I'm totally bummed. A nice sushi place in the neighborhood would have been great.

Next time we will keep on driving, you should too.",1,"bad"
"5","CHECK OUT MY AVATAR! ITS HAMACHI/ YELLOWTAIL. Thats how it was served. No joke.

If only i could have rated this lower, i would have. Im not the troll under the bridge, nor am i a perfectionist. I understand when you are busy, and when you are understaffed, but ignoring a group of 4 customers, for the better part of an hour, who are sitting ringside, is unacceptable. 

We sat where we wanted, and had to ask the nice, slightly english-deprived asian woman for lemon water. A few times. Another wait for lemons, what I originally asked for. 

While we were getting water, one of the wasabi/ ginger dishes (btw the wasabi was very fresh, i will give them that), had gunk on it, from another customer or failed dishwashing incident. I asked for a new dish for my friend. At this time we all ordered something. During this time, i did receive a lemon slice. 

My girlfriend received her first roll. One of the other friends also recieved his roll. We were then asked again what we wanted to order. I ordered something else, and let them just make it and bring it to me. My friend with the dirty dish had to ask the same asian lady for that replacement dish, which was no help as the replacement had some gunk on it as well...Finally receive my first roll. It was a Lulu and pretty good. 

My friend with the dirty dish*2 finally got his order, and it was exactly half of what he ordered. 8 pieces of Nigiri, which only took 45 minutes. 

We did get an order of Hamachi, but it was covered in bloody bits of fat, which made my friend, a very accepting fellow, send back due because he didnt want to have to call in due to food poisoning. I have the picture and because i am unable to upload it, i will use it as my Avatar pic. 

After almost an hour there, and only 1 roll apiece, and after looking for a manager type in the back kitchen ( no one would have time, one more moment from the chefs always), we up and left the restaurant and left $20 in cash for our troubles. Ive never just left a restaurant without trying to explain to someone why we are unsatisfied. You cant learn if you are not told you are doing it wrong. 

The place also had a distinct fishy smell, no lie, and the whole restaurant felt of cheap. Not begrudging ANYONE who wants to cut a corner a little corner to make profit, but cutting the placemats in half to get double the amount of uses out of them, really? Whats next, re-usable plastic chop sticks? Re-usable, washable seaweed paper?

I, and all in my party were just blown away, in a co-medically bad experience here. 

I dont understand how anyone could rate this place above a 1. No way. Unless they just got out of a POW camp, or had to survive on insects and raw animal waste. 

Update: My girlfriend just informed me, 2 hours after the meal, she just threw up. I guess that clinches it for me. May your visit be much better, i will not be returning.",2,"bad"
