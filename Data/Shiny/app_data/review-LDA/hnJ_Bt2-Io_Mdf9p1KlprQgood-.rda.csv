"2","We haven't visited this restaurant since it served solely Japanese cuisine;  maybe four years ago.  There have been positive changes to the decor in the dining room that reflect more of a Thai sensibility.  We were quickly greeted and seated.

Being hungry and wanting to try a variety of dishes off their new menu, we started with their Sampler appetizer ($10.99) and a bowl of Tom Kha with Chicken ($3.99).  The Sampler was surprisingly good with the star being their shrimp tempura.  Good sign!  The soup was also quite good.  We asked for the spice tray so that we could add a little heat to the soup however, all they offer is red pepper flakes.  I consider that unacceptable in any Thai restaurant.  Thai food begs for condiments of at least Sriracha and Fish Sauce along with the pepper flakes.

For entr√©es, we decided to try some sushi.  We ordered the Special Sunomono ($10.95), the Special Volcano Roll ($10.95), Tampa ($4.99) and Mexican ($5.50) rolls.  The sunomono was very fresh and had a great variety of white fish, salmon, octopus, shrimp and tuna.  The Volcano Roll was the star.  The Mexican was fine and the Tampa was OK but not our favorite.(see pics)

Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience.  Our server, Usara, was cheerful, chatty and helpful.  On our next visit, we will definitely try different Thai and Japanese offerings.  Like us, if you had some prior misgivings, please give them another chance.  I do not think that you will be disappointed!",1,"good"

It is a must try if you come. I would warn to stay away from the Thai food as its not that great. The house soup is a nice homemade broth, the ginger salad is yum-o. Green tea ice cream is really good. And one quirk I love about this place is there coca cola. It is always extra syrupy and it tastes soo sweet and good. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the change from solely Japanese to also Thai. The old staff knew my family by name and the old decor was fine with me.",2,"good"
