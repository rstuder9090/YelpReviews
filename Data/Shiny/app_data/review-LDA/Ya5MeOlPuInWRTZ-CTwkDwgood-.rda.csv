"2","I'm a huge fan of Asian and Pan-Asian food.  This has to be the finest Buffet in Bucks County.  The place is squeaky clean, rest rooms are clean as they should be.  The Sushi bar is where I go first.  Offerings are fresh, tasty, and I have found that I can trust their seafood.  Other food tables (and there are quite a few), are constantly attended and kept fresh.  I eat lunch here 1-2 times per week.  They offer a Seniors discount.  Staff is friendly and very polite.  
     I haven't tried the dessert bar, but it looks appetizing and neatly presented.  I don't know how they keep the variety coming, but they do.  My custom at the Sushi Bar is to tip the Sushi Chef.  It's a Japanese Custom that I observe.  There are large back rooms for private parties.  There was even an Asian Wedding that I saw there.
Considering all of the competition, this is the best Asian Buffet that I've tried.  Price is fair and ri",1,"good"
"3","I love this place! It is not like many buffets I have been to. The place is clean, even their bathrooms are clean! Staff is very nice and attentive. One of the management came over and talked to us awhile about suggestions we had and the plans they had to improve the restaurant. 

The food is very good. I always like to get Hibachi, and I pick over all the other stuff. They have Chinese, Japanese, and American foods. While they have things like deserts, fried food, etc., the owner told us that they have a philosophy of making healthier food. They work with the local schools teaching cooks how to cook healthier. They also take over the leftover food every night to some of the local shelters.

My wife loves the sushi. It has always been fresh and they are always making new items. Also, the price is cheap. We always go for lunch and it costs $7.99, except on Sundays I believe. 

If you want to eat healthy or bad, they have plenty. But I would say they have more on the healthier side than bad. I know they do not use MSG. I follow a Paleo diet, and there is plenty to eat. It is tempting to eat the 'bad stuff', but there is more than enough food if you are trying to eat Paleo or Vegan.

We have been back 10 times since they opened. It is cheaper to go there for my wife and me than it is to get a pizza.",2,"good"
