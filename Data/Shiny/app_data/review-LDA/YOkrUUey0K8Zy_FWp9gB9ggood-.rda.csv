"2","I love Asahi Sushi. I should preface this review by stating that if it involves mayo, a fryer, or fruit; I can promise you I'm not interested. I don't eat fancy rolls. Fancy sushi for me, is a unique fish that I haven't had before. 

Asahi's fish is fresh. As a result, the flavor is full and rich and the texture is perfect. Their house salad isn't the best that I've ever had. Their seaweed salad is good as well. I also really enjoy their vegetable tempura and the Japanese pickles.  

If you are a nigiri sushi fanatic, ask the sushi chef what he recommends. The other night he suggested monkfish liver. It was really good. He's also got my boyfriend and I hooked on this amazing tuna and bonita. One of the rolls that we do enjoy here is the salmon skin roll. Crunchy and delicious. 

No one eats here. I don't know why. As a result, the service has always been really great! I don't think that they are slower than any other sushi restaurant. 

My ONLY problem with Asahi is that they are located in Belle Meade and it's a small hike for us to get over there. It's probably for the best. If they were closer, I'd probably turn into a piece of sushi because I'd eat here everyday.",1,"good"
"3","I feel the need to write this review to counter all of the bad reviews! My husband and I have been eating at Asahi since it resided on the corner of Harding Pike and Harding Place. I do miss the hole in the wall location a bit but the newer location is more spacious. Luke and his wife are lovely people and we like supporting a locally owned family business. 

When reading the bad reviews I kept thinking people are confusing Asahi with a different Japanese restaurant because we've never encountered the problems others are describing. First and foremost, the sushi is always fresh! In all the years eating there we've never had any fish that seemed even slightly ""off"" as one person described. While we order rolls we mostly choose Nigiri where it's imperative it is fresh because you can't camouflage the taste with the ingredients you might find in a roll. We eat Salmon, Tuna, Yellow Tail Octopus etc. There are a variety of rolls with choices that have grown over the years and we each have our favorites. My current favorite is the Music City roll and of course the California roll. The ingredients in each roll are on the menu so no surprises there. 

We've also both had Chicken and Shrimp teriyaki and enjoyed both. It's never dry and always flavorful. The beer is always cold.

People have mentioned that you don't see many customers, however it all depends on the day and time. What many don't realize is Asahi also has a huge take out business! Our orders are split between take out and eat in but we have Asahi at least once a week.

We've eaten at other Sushi restaurants around town but Asahi is hands down our favorite. It's laid back and family friendly and easy to spot a neighbor or two. 

Many of the Yelp reviews are old for Asahi so I actually would not use Yelp as my primary review source for this restaurant.",2,"good"
