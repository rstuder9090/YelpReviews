The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",1,"good"

The menu ranges from sushi to bowls with a healthy dose of standard fairs in between. Bubble teas are also available, though I didn't try and of those today.

My lunch partner just wanted something small so he order Miso soup with a few egg rolls.  He said the miso was fantastic and he really enjoyed it.

I opted for a create your own bowl, and was given a card to fill out with all my selections. I ordered my bowl over mixed greens with Korean beef bbq and teriyaki chicken, pineapple, mixed bell peppers, cucumber, sesame seeds, with a light Japanese mayo sauce.

The beef was phenomenal, i loved it! The chicken was really good as well, overall the bowl was really delicious.  The edamame was ok, I should have done the meal option better. If you pick a meal for an extra $3 you get several sides to choose from including the choice of a drink.  Potstickers, soup, egg rolls, and other standards are all part of those options.

Overall I really enjoyed my meal, though the price was a bit higher than i would like for the portion.  I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu offerings.",2,"good"

Really disorganized.  Takes forever to get your order.  Very small space in this location and there are people standing in line right next to the tables.  Doesn't make sense for lunch if you only have a short amount of time. 

After 20 minutes, I had to remind them to finish making my Order of 2 basic Rolls to go. 

The first roll sat on the make counter uncut for 15 Minutes, while the guy was on the phone and then girl was off working on another order placed AFTER mine.

So I paid $14.17 for these 2.  No utensils, No napkins, No wasabi and No soy sauce in box.  

Never going back.  Too much of a hassle.  Ugh. CJ",1,"bad"
"5","Man, I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this place, since it's right next to my work, but alas, not a lunchtime keeper.

Pros: Staff was super nice and helpful. Place looked clean. Lots of options. You can watch staff make your food.

Con (big one): Product. Maybe I am being too picky but I ordered a poke bowl (rice, smoked salmon, avocado, pineapple and jalapeno). I watched the woman make the bowl and as she got to the pineapple, I noticed it was the canned stuff. Then, the jalapenos came, and they were the pickled kind you get with nachos. I looked at the finished product and it was just kind of sad. The salmon was...OK. I ended up eating part of it and just realizing it wasn't worth it, so I threw the rest away.

I don't know--maybe the cooked bowls and sushi are better? I just don't think it's worth coming back.",2,"bad"
