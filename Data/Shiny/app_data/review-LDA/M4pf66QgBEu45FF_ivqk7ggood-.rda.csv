"2","Newly opened on the 600-block of Central Avenue, Pacific Counter provides a fresh spin on lunch-on-the-go. The concept is essentially Chipotle for sushi (but note that the comparison begins and ends with the similarity in format!). You can create your own bowl or sushi burrito, picking from a variety of protein options, mix-ins, and toppings, all on a base of brown rice, sushi rice, noodles, or mixed greens, or a half-and-half mix of bases. Your food can be taken to go or eaten at their tall counter and booth seating.
The variety and quantity of options stand out as a major draw. There are 10 proteins to pick from, and you get to choose two (salmon, tuna, shrimp, calamari, tofu, chicken, and krab, as well as spicy salmon, tuna, and tofu). The choices of mix-ins and toppings (pick 5) are extensive and range from veggies and fresh fruits, slaws and salads, and kimchi, to typical roll toppers like masago, shredded nori, and sesame seeds. The eight different sauce options are all house-made with varying levels of spiciness. They also offer a small menu of ""Counter Creations"" - pre-selected blends of menu items, like one based off of the ingredients of a Rainbow California roll. 
Everything is $12, and the add-on prices for extra items are reasonable. It's a very affordable price point given that they're working with some generally pricey ingredients, doling out a hearty portion, and everything is high-quality, fresh, and delicious. With the variety of ingredients coming together in your bowl or burrito, it's certainly comparable to a $14-15 specialty roll at a sushi bar, except that you're getting a bigger portion, convenient packaging, and the ability to pick and choose all of your favorite elements.
The beverage menu is equally exciting, with alcoholic choices ranging from imported Japanese beers to sake slushies. The juice and tea options are housemade and looked divine - a honey hibiscus Palmer, and a matcha limeade stood out from a colorful lineup of choices.
What can, of course, make or break any business is customer service, and Pacific Counter is very much on the right track. Each of the three folks who handled my transaction (two to assemble, one to ring it up), was genuinely warm and friendly and projected a feeling of being happy to be there. They all seemed truly excited to be preparing delicious, healthy food for St. Pete.
Pacific counter is a bright, fun, unique addition to the DTSP/Central Avenue scene, and I am already excited to make my next sushi creation and try out a beverage!
I had a bowl to go with a brown rice/mixed greens base topped with salmon and tuna, cucumber, avocado, radish sprouts, mango, and masago with the citrus wasabi yuzu sauce. This sauce is listed as having mild spice; I didn't find spicy at all, which was good news for me as I'm very sensitive to heat. It was creamy, citrus-y, light, and flavorful.",1,"good"
"3","I was at a Rowdies game with my girlfriend when I saw the banner ads for Pacific Counter. Living in Tampa and not too familiar with some of the hotter or newer spots on this side of the bay, we decided to check it out after the game and, boy, did it NOT disappoint! 

We walked into a clean and bright restaurant, no long line and plenty of smiling faces eager to explain to me the menu options. If I worked downtown this would easily be my new go-to for lunch. The fact that it's open till midnight is an added bonus next time I come for First Friday (although I'll be coming here at any hour of the day when I'm on this side of the bay!).

The concept was simple: rolls or bowls. My coworker always talked about the concept of a Sushi-rrito and hyped it up as a rare treat that was hard to come by, so much so that the only time I've ever tried it was her homemade one. That was until we walked into Pacific Counter! I went with the roll since I was craving a Sushi-rrito and was super hungry (Over the Rainbow). My girlfriend went with a bowl (Land & Sea). Both were super flavorful and fresh. The best part was EVERY aspect of their menu can be customized, which is good for someone like me who's a little more mild with his spices and a girlfriend with dietary restrictions.

After our meal we tried their slush drink and, me being the indecisive person I am, they were able to swirl both the Saki and Ros√© together for an amazing adult beverage. On top of that, my girlfriend nearly had a heart attack when she saw they had Pineapple Dole Whip. We've only had this in Disney, so seeing this outside of Orlando was a shock. At only 80 calories a serving (I think?), it is the ULTIMATE guilt-less treat. If I could, I would eat that Dole Whip all day. 

All in all, what an amazing experience to stumble into this gem along Central! A fantastic concept full of delicious options and friendly staff. I will definitely be back and now have one more great reason to come to St. Pete! When will they be opening one up in Tampa??",2,"good"
