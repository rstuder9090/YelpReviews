"2","So excited to have another healthily and delicious restaurant in Hernando County!  Went with a party of five, so we had a nice menu assortment at the table.  Everything was delicious.  My favorite was the spicy tuna salad which was light (no mayo....finally!) and the goyza.  The fancy roll and spicy tuna roll looked terrific.  Beautiful plate presentation.  They pre-bussed the tables (which is usually a lost step in service at most restaurants around here), filled our drinks without us needing to ask and served the kitchen orders quickly.  Sushi took a little longer, but that is to be expected. Excellent job and terrific food! Yea Hernando!

Oh....as to the review about size...they do not put a lot of rice in their rolls.  I personally prefer less rice so the flavor of the fish is more prominent.  That is a personal preference and not deserving of three stars.",1,"good"
"3","Just want to comment on ""Michael G.'s"" review. We were actually there on September 7th and seated RIGHT BEHIND THEM when their kid got sick. Why would THE RESTAURANT apologize for your kid throwing up everywhere? If you were implying he got food poisoning literally 5 minutes after eating their food, please try to make your story more realistic. You can't get food poisoning that fast. And since we were THERE that night, we had sushi and an entree from the kitchen and DID NOT get food poisoning. And according to Michael's other reviews his kid threw up at ANOTHER restaurant? Maybe instead of spending your time and energy posting bogus reviews for no reason, you can take your son to the doctor because he obviously has some dietary issues. I reported his bogus review and hope it gets deleted, because also, ew? Who posts photos like that to Yelp? 

Now, for the review of the actual restaurant. I have been going to this place for as long as it's been open. I have take-out ordered here MANY times and have dined here and It's always clean and the food is extremely fresh. It is one of (if not the best) place in Spring Hill for sushi. I think *one* time the service was a bit slow but not anything to complain about. We just dined here again tonight and the sushi was fantastic along with the service (and it was pretty busy). The restaurant is also very nicely decorated and hip. My only complaints are that the takeout orders do take longer sometimes and that they have recently hiked the prices up on their food. But there has never been any concern over cleanliness or taste of the food.",2,"good"
"4","Man...where do I begin?
Took about 15 minutes and asking the hostess to get us water after ordering with the waitress. 
The rest of the meal came at different intervals. 
My wife asked for a fork and was offered PLASTIC forks. Are you kidding me??
Finally, the meal came, or part of it.
Wife's meal arrived and I expected my sushi (not cooked, shoulda been there) shortly after. 
After some patience, I inquired again.
Then again a few more times!!!!
Finally after more than 15 minutes after my wife FINISHED her meal, I was told they are making it.
Supposed, they moved from NY to here, NY or Springhill, service was absolutely terrible and you have been added to the crappy restaurant list!!
Why can't people just do their job and run a business the right way.
Also, the owner/manager spend the entire time we were there drooling over a hottie and literally babysitting a 4 year old kid.
Help me to understand why this place even exists???
E-Sushi, your place sucks!!",1,"bad"
"5","Sushi should have flavored rice.  Most sushi chiefs or sushi restaurants have their own recipe for flavoring the rice, not here, just plain rice.  Flavor of the sushi rolls was non existent. I always order spicy tuna and it wasn't spicy at all much to my dismay.  All the rolls I ordered had the spicy tuna as an ingredient and all the rolls were pretty much without any real flavor.  They were all very nice looking, well presented and the service was not bad at all considering it was full.  I ordered a bowel of Miso soup and it came out cold, the tofu in it were like little ice cubes.
There are other places in the area that have better sushi, sushi with flavor, spicy tuna with a bite (although the best spicy tuna was when Todai was here).
Wife had the shrimp tempura and is was okay, but just okay.  All this being said we nay go back to try some other offerings.",2,"bad"
