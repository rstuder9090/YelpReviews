My earliest thought association for Japanese restaurants is quality service that honors the customer.  After entering this truly spectacular sushi bar/restaurant and soaking in the lighting that perfectly illuminates the thoughtfully designed interior our waitress brings us moist towelettes to clear our hands with.  That is the beginning of a spectacular meal and the quality service only increased as the meal progressed.  The sushi chef greeted us and everyone smiled.  They wanted to know if we were happy ... they did all they could to make us happy.

I usually do not spend much time considering a restaurant's interior design although dining out is a complete sensual experience.  So, let me just say that the layout for Shogun deserves 5 stars.  The simplistic look is so perfect for a Japanese restaurant and the white that predominates is a perfect match to the multiple colors on the plates that are served.

Shogun offers diners a great selection of sushi and sashimi and for this meal I went for the TUNA MANGO TARTAR along with a simple YELLOWTAIL SCALLION ROLL to start the meal!  WOW did these two items deliver ... the TARTAR's presentation was truly ""eye candy"" that enticed the taste buds but at the same time you didn't want to take apart the chef's presentation.  It was colorful with perfectly diced mango and tuna showcasing the chef's knife skills and dedication to presentation.  The Yusu Sauce was a delicious partner and the thin strips of radish offset the tartar perfectly.  Did I mention how YUMMY this was?  The roll couldn't compete with its appetizer partner although the tuna was fresh and the quality of the sushi chef was evident even in this simple item.

But the STAR ... the SUPERSTAR ... the OH MY GOODNESS SUPERSTAR was my entree, the GRILLED CHILEAN SEA BASS in MISO SAUCE.  Friday's I have often sought out fish fries but on this evening the photo perfect presentation could only hint at this perfect fish.  This might be the best fish I have ever had at a restaurant ... it is definitely the best I have had in a very long time.  First, the presentation was awesome and the accompanying veggies made for a colorful contrast to the fish's miso sauce.  They were cooked perfected.  But the fish ... moist ... warm edging close to hot but flaky and tender ... oh sooo good!  I savored each bite.  The sauce was delicious the miso coming through but not taking away anything from the sea bass's delicate flavors.  My chopsticks tried to take very small pieces to insure that the fish lasted as long as possible ... I savored this meal and our waitress who kept checking to make sure we were happy said that if I liked the sea bass that I would really like the MISO BLACK COD with MISO SAUCE.  WOAH ... if I liked the sea bass?  I LOVED the SEA BASS, which means either that COD can't compete or I am really in for a treat when I return to SHOGUN.

The SHRIMP and SCALLOP HIBACHI was flavorful with more than enough shrimp and scallops.  The veggies and presentation were evidence again of a careful kitchen.

The meal was wrapped up with the classic sweet orange cut into pieces surrounded by some truly palate pleasing mochi. 

Leaving everyone said goodbye and thank you ... waitress, hostess, sushi chef ... my goodness it was a wonderful feeling and OH MY OH MY what a delicious meal.

Just remember ... let your GPS SHOW YOU the way because you don't want to miss SHO GUN and if you drive past it turn around so that you can enjoy the experience.

An added note, as we left it was clear that the staff knows many of the customers.  Obviously once you are shown the way to SHOGUN you know how to return.
