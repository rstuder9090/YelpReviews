"2","I feel so lucky that I moved to Santa Barbara and almost immediately was introduced to this real deal Sushi place.  The owner, Ryoji, is beyond, beyond experienced.  As I sat and ate my handroll, I asked him about his history in the business.  He calmly explained to me about the people that used to dine with him when he worked in Malibu.  It was a Hollywood A list, for sure.  Yet, Ryoji has an amazing amount of humility regarding his craft.  He focused solely on the food and preparing it at this sandwhich shop by day and Sushi restaurant by night.  He is open 6 to close on Tuesday through Saturday.  I arrived at about 5:30pm and because the door was open, I was able to watch him prepare his specials for the night.  The tuna on tuna special roll that ordered after my hand roll was divine. ...And I have known some other really good Sushi place  in my time. Ryoji is what makes this place so special.
So, go and enjoy this small and wonderful place.  Watch this master and his humble staff be so attentive to food and the service.  The most difficult part is deciding what to eat!",1,"good"
"3","There are plenty of sushi options in Santa Barbara. However, I'm a purist and I don't care for pages of fancy roll options. I want some good old fashioned traditional sushi.

They've set up shop in the Three Pickles Deli downtown. They run a curtain that cuts the room in half, leaving 20 seats for customers.

The menu is limited, but everything we ordered was delicious. We started with nigiri: Hotate Scallop, Hamachi, and Seared Ahi with Black Pepper. The scallop was super sweet and flavorful with a nice kick of wasabi. The hamachi was a nice portion that melted in your mouth. The Ahi was very good but I think was overshadowed by the deliciously simple scallop. Then we got the chef's special Ceviche Roll. Despite the fact that I had originally ordered the Suzuki nigiri, we accepted the Ceviche Roll and it turned out to be delicious. There was ika, tako and a yummy tangy flavor. I was surprised how much I liked it. A small downside was a citrus seed in the mix. Last, we had the chef's special Poke Roll. The poke had nice flavor and was on top of a roll that was stuffed with delicious seaweed salad with jellyfish.

Everything we had was very good, and I would have no objection to ordering it again. I do, however, want to go back for the Suzuki!

[2014.03.13] Went back again and got the Suzuki! Also tried the albacore and unagi. All were delicious but my favorite was the unagi. No soy sauce needed on any of it.",2,"good"
