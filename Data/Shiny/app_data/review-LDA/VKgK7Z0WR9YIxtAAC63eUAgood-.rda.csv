"2","Born and raised in Hawaii, I was spoiled with quality fish... So when it comes to sushi, I need quality to satisfy my taste buds... and quantity to satisfy my stomach... We come to Reno annually for my sons AAU basketball tournament and we normally go to Kokopelli's inside Silver Legacy. This time around, I wanted to try out something different and since we were staying at the Peppermill (which is only a couple blocks away), Sushi Pier 2 was gonna be our AYCE sushi spot for this trip... and after our experience, I'm sure for many more to come. AYCE sushi is very reasonably priced at $16.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner. I guarantee you, my teenage son and I ate probably $100 worth of sushi each!  

Ok, for starters, the place is pretty big. Big enough that it has 2 sushi bars, one in the middle/left of the restaurant and one in the back. There's also a regular bar in the front of the restaurant as well. It looked like they accommodated a party of 35-40 sitting next to us, which was good to know. It's decorated nicely, contemporary but not overkill... flat screen TVs are almost everywhere you look, which is good for sports fans! 

I read previous reviews complaining about their slow service but after eating there, I realized that the ""slow"" service isn't necessarily because of lack of professionalism or attentiveness but more or less due to the fact that they're BUSY! Again, there was a party of 35-40 next to us, along with your usual parties of 4, 6, 8, etc... and the restaurant was pretty full all the way until closing! I'd also like to add that my wife is super picky and needs all kinds of customizations when she orders food (smdh)... Good news was that our server (I think he may have been the owner) had no problem taking stuff out and/or adding stuff in to any of the rolls she ordered! (HUGE plus... you have no idea)

OK. Now to the sushi... everything we ordered came pretty fast! My younger son ordered the chicken teriyaki /shrimp tempura combo and that was at our table within 10 minutes. Every time we handed our waiter the AYCE sushi order form, our rolls were out within 5-10min max. I can't remember all the names of the rolls we ordered... BUT if there's ONE THING you must try... it's the BBQ AHI (tuna) NIGIRI. HO-LEE-SH*T. I thought I died and went to sushi heaven... We ordered a total of 10 orders of the BBQ ahi nigiri... yup... 20 pieces. It's THAT good. If you love sushi and you're ever in Reno, you have to try that damn BBQ ahi nigiri... great stuff! Overall, every maki roll, nigiri, handroll we ordered was very well plated and delicious! High quality fish and what I thought was excellent service! We just found our new annual sushi spot in Reno!",1,"good"
"3","def come to this bigger, newer locay INSTEAD of the tiny, old, small-portion original!!!...our experience @the other one wasn't good jus a couple of mos ago...so, we were hesitant to take the folks to this sister resto...but decided we'd give it a chance...& glad the 4 of us did...tho we considered other AYCE sushi bars @several hotels, Sushi Pier offers some apps for our fam... lunch 11a-3p, $17.95 (kids 7 & undr: $9.95)...din 3-9:30p (avail all day if u want din long rolls too), $23.95 (kids $15.95)...made-to-order sushi & jap noms...
