"2","Beer to go, Chinese food, sushi, and a whole lot more all under one roof. Capital Beer has something for everyone which is why I really hope it succeeds.  From Olde English 40's, PBR, and domestics to micro brews and yuppie hipster beers. Dutch master cigars to Newports. Skittles to M&Ms. Burgers, fried chicken, and french fries to General Tso's to sushi. The only thing missing was 1/2"" Plexiglas.

There has been a lot of buzz about a place with such an eclectic mix of offerings and the recently opened restaurant, sushi bar, bottle shop was pretty busy when I went for dinner last night. They have a decent amount of seating inside and a small sushi bar. Beer is in display cases behind the counter which is a pain but, well, necessary. They have a good selection, though not as large as Bottle Bar East or the Foodery, and the prices were pretty good.

The food is probably more like 3 stars, nothing horrible and nothing extraordinary. I was surprised by the sushi, I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. The Chinese food was the typical take out menu. My lo mein was a little greasy but it's take out Chinese.

Service was decent especially for being so busy. It did take a while to pay the check. But they do use iPads to take orders and square to accept credit cards which is nice. The inside looks to be completely redone and is nice, clean, and updated. They also have a TV displaying the feeds from about as many cameras as the big brother house, which I'm going to say is a good thing.

Like I said, food wise it's more of a 3 star joint, which isn't a bad thing, but given their wide range of offerings and ability to serve multiple needs for townie and hipster alike, I really hope this place does well.",1,"good"
"3","Get Chinese food!!! I read a few of these reviews  which prompted me to write this...I love this place it's my go-to Chinese food not just for location but because of quality of service and food. Never got sick in the years since it opened, never found hair  in my wonton (which sounds like a made  up story and I think that picture was staged) if there's an oddball beer I want then they have it or  they'll  get it but they have my standbys usually. Here's a tip if you wanna complain about sushi tho, don't order a cheeseburger at a taco stand, the same way you shouldn't  order sushi from a Chinese/ beer store. These people are nice and the food is good, 
Sweet n Sour Chicken, General Tso's chicken  (ask for extra  crispy)  moo goo gai pan, wonton soup and egg drop soup and lastly chicken with garlic sauce, it doesn't taste garlicky like the title suggests but picture chicken and broccoli with more veggies than just broccoli with a similar sauce that tastes a tiny bit spicier. If you go here  and somehow have a bad experience just go again- not everyone's perfect the first time, and especially if you ordered during a rush-think how many times you dropped the  ball on  a first impression. I  know  you don't have to smile or politely ask how their day is going, no one has to do that but maybe you should, happy people=happy food which = happy people.  anyways if you're new to the area or just passing through eat well and drink well here.",2,"good"
"4","I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone reading all of these positive reviews. What is going on here?? I just finished my meal and can't even wait until tomorrow morning to write the review! This is definitely not the answer to our lack of Chinese and sushi restaurants.

All of the food here was absolutely flavorless, served in heaping portions, and mushy. 

The egg roll was seriously filled with kimchi. The inside was pink and tasted like vinegar. When I asked my husband what he thought of it he couldn't put his finger on the weird flavor. When I suggested it tasted like kimchi he was like YES!

The beef with broccoli and the lo mein both tasted like MSG and nothingness. My husband referred to the lo mein as ""brown noodles.""

The wonton soup was the only marginally edible thing here, but you don't get much in your order, so there's that. 

The sushi was worse than grocery store sushi. The seaweed wrap was in edible in that you couldn't chew it! It wouldn't break up in my mouth. It just basically un-rolled itself while I was chewing. 

The water (yes I'm about to talk about tap water) tasted like plastic. Maybe it was the glass (which wasn't made of glass)? Who knows. 

The waitress was very nice and said ""thank you"" after every sentence, but she messed up my order and brought me house lo mein instead of just pork. Also, the credit card system is very odd and we didn't get a receipt. 

This joint would be great for beer and convenience store offerings. Please, don't make the mistake we did and eat here. I can't fault them for trying to cover the need, but it's just not good.",1,"bad"
"5","I really want this place to succeed because I love sushi and the neighborhood lacks any such restaurants. But I'm afraid it's doomed like every other business that has occupied that building in the past 15 years (and there have been MANY).

The sushi has to be graded on a curve. For the neighborhood, it's 5-star. But if this business were in Center City, it would be a 2-star last resort. What I hate about this observation is that sushi, if taken seriously, can be truly mind-blowing when made well. 

But these kids -- yes, it's run by kids -- don't take it seriously. In fact, they don't seem to take any part of the business seriously. I've spent a lot of time waiting for an order to go, watching them barely lift a finger, roll their eyes at customers, play on their phones, and ignore new guests. 

(And about waiting for an order to go... you better bring a book, because these guys are sssllloooooooowwwwwww).

I get the distinct impression that one of their parents owns the business, that Capital Beer is someone's ""starter job,"" and that all of the employees are the owner's kid's friends. Colossal turnoff. 

For me, the food is good enough. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",2,"bad"
