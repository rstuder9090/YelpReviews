"2","I had a sushi burrito and I loved it! I was a little nervous. Would the seaweed wrap be chewy? Would it stay together? Would the flavors work? The sushi burrito anxiety was real and it took me awhile to try it. If you feel like this, don't worry. It is not that scary. 

The Spot is combined with Ha Long Bay. You can actually order Pho with your sushi burrito! Anyway, if you walk into ""The Spot"" side of the restaurant, you will see that you order your burrito like you would a certain fast food Mexican burrito.

First you pick burrito, bowl or salad. Then you pick your protein. You can pick two or three for a higher price. Then you pick sauce, veggies, and toppings. Then you watch your beauty be wrapped into a burrito. 

I ordered a burrito with salmon and tempura shrimp (I highly recommend both). I then asked about the sauce and was recommended the spicy sauce since I am a heat fiend. I added cucumber, carrots, and jalapenos. I then added sesame seeds and little crunch wontons for texture. 

Some of the things that you could also add that I remember were tuna, corn, cilantro, red onion, avocado (upcharge), asparagus (upcharge). There were a lot of other choices too, but that is what I can recall.  

I grabbed a drink, a container of soy and lots of napkins (note: grab extra! Burritos are a little messy if you are like me and dip in soy).

The first bite was magical. It was super fresh, delicious, salty and crunchy all at once. Each subsequent bite just reinforced my joy. I polished it off and left very happy. I will definitely return soon. It is a little pricey, but I think that it is worth it. You have to try a sushi burrito if you are a sushi fan. You will love it!",1,"good"
"3","I am in love with their sushi burrito.

My sister calls sushi burritos, burrushi. I don't know if this is an L.A. hipster label or if that is its formal name. Either way, it is now stuck in my mind so I'm going to try to make it a thing, because it's so fetch (anyone get the Mean Girls quote?).  

Burrushi is huge in California, but it is only now beginning to gain popularity in the Tampa Bay area. I wouldn't say that Largo is a huge trendsetter, but it may be trying to prove me wrong. I often scoff at restaurants that are an odd combination of different ethnic foods (I just saw a restaurant that touted Thai, Chinese, and Greek food - uuuhhhh), but here I relish the fact that they have burrushi and Vietnamese. My husband would never agree to eat burrushi, but he loves a good banh mi! This means both of us are happy - it's a win win!

There are two doors, one for the burrushi side and one for the Vietnamese side. You can order burrushi on the Vietnamese side. For those of you who run cold, like I do, bring a sweater. Even if it is blistering hot outside, it is pretty cold inside. This makes sense, because you want to keep your fresh fish cold, but my fingers were blue by the time we left. The restaurant is clean and had cheery accents of bright green. This is a great restaurant for a date!

I got the Original Sushi Burrito with Spicy Mayo. I wasn't adventurous enough to make my own burrushi yet. After eating my burrushi, I now question why I would even want to mess with perfection. It is divine. It was the perfect amount of fish, vegetables, and rice all wrapped in soy paper. It came with three shrimp chips. I know, three sounds stingy, but they are large shrimp chips and the star of the show is definitely the burrushi. I was afraid it wouldn't fill me up, but I was wrong. It is the perfect lunch portion.

Of course, I had to try my husband's food as well. He got the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich, without mayo, pate, or jalapenos and the appetizer of fried chicken. Both were good. I'm used to my banh mi bread being toasted, so the lack of crispiness threw me off a little, but it was still a solid sandwich. I always love the way Asians fry their chicken. I think it is something about the coating that I really enjoy. I would recommend both of them, but not above the burrushi.

Come and try the burrushi. You will become a fan.",2,"good"
"4","Perhaps my friend and I are too much of a traditionalist but the Vietnamese,  Japanese, and Mexican fusion wasn't happening for us. 
The seaweed wrap made the sushi burrito chewy and difficult to bite into. The tuna was cut into big chunks so it made us feel like we were biting into a hunk of raw fish. 
We also had a rice bowl. That was good but not good enough for me to want to order it again. 
I was really hoping to love it here and surprise my boyfriend with a sushi burrito, at his job nearby, but I didn't want to take the chance and order him one and he not like it either.  
Oh well. It was a unique experience with good company. 
All the ingredients were very fresh and the restraurant was clean.",1,"bad"
"5","This was my first sushi burrito trip; over all the experience was sub-par.  Food was 10/10 - excellent!  When I initially walked in there was a sushi chef that explained there are actually two different restaurants in the same building and I could either order there or sit ""For the whole dining experience?"" Never had that happen prior but that's cool.  Sever had no idea what beers were in the cooler & had to go back and look.  When he arrived back I asked for yuengling as I noticed it in the cooler, he stated they didn't have it - they did lol.  I ordered Edamame - no dish to discard the shells was given; had to ask.  Half a dozen other things.  I will say the staff is friendly, however 100% demonstrated lackadaisical behavior on this visit at least my server did.  Get the staff half-way trained up at minimum - know your menu and beers you sell guys and get off your phone bro.  Food was good - I might return",2,"bad"
