"2","The waitress had great timing. She was very nice. The food was exceptional and comparable in prices. Restaurant is clean. IThai  has sushi rolls. Everything we ate was delicious. We ate shrimp tempura that came with fresh, seasonal tempura vegetables. and it was lightly breaded and crunchy, typical soy sauce. The dumplings were the size of a small meatball served in a steamer basket with a sweet teriyaki sauce. Pork fried rice had large chunks of pork and scrambled eggs, a meal in itself. The crab Rangoon was crispy shell with the creamiest filling. It tasted like the crab roe which was soooo good. Miso soup was good and everything was placed on a bed of lettuce. The satay was tender and the peanut sauce was also creamy (Not gritty like some restaurants)! The menu was filled with different types of curry dishes, pho, and sushi. Visit this family owned business on Seminole blvd! You won't be sorry!",1,"good"

You don't really know what to expect judging by the outside. Inside, it's a cute little spot, a traditional Thai decor with tables in the center and booths around the sides in two rooms.

On a recent Monday night there were only 2 other couples dining, but the take out business was booming. That's always an encouraging sign. It's an extensive menu with all of the traditional Thai dishes, plus a wide variety of sushi. 

Amy tried the pad thai with chicken. This was excellent, among the best we've had. The noodles were cooked slightly al dente, the peanut sauce sweet and creamy, the garnishes of scallion and bean sprouts crisp and fresh. A generous portion of sliced broiled chicken topped the dish. This was ordered medium hot, and the spice is what you would expect - resulting in a runny nose and rosy cheeks but tasty in every bite.

I had the green curry with shrimp.  The curry was smooth and creamy with just a little heat, brimming with red and yellow bell pepper slices and at least 10 nice sized shrimp.  The shrimp were well prepared, a nice snap to each bite, firm and not mealy.  A generous scoop of perfect sticky rice (molded into the shape of a star, a nice touch) is served on the side.  The curry over that rice is to die for!

The tab for two was $30 including 2 soft drinks, so inexpensive.  If you're looking for excellent Thai food in a comfortable environment right here in town, try IThai. Recommended.",2,"good"
