"2","How can it be that this place is around 2 years old, peeps here on yelp mentioning their name in other reviews, yet not having a review of their own? A little strange, to say the least. Well, here's their 1st review and from a Californian nonetheless, strange, right? 

An ambitious restaurant in a business-park zoned area made it a strange find. Upon entering however you're presented with a sleek, modern interior worthy of a romantic date. Curved, deep maroon walls flow throughout the space making the seating arrangement interesting. A far eastern touch is present as the larger tables had a marble lazy susan to spin your dishes to be served family style, nice looking but very cumbersome to spin. Metal chain mail see- through 
curtains separate the larger tables and is actually effective in providing a sense of separation from other diners. 

The service is western style with personable servers who pays attention to detail with wine service, verbal specials announcements and a comfy warm towel service at the end of the meal. The food is primarily Americanized Chinese food presented in a more stylish manner, real similar to PF Changs, only it taste more authentic. There is also a separate sushi bar area which can get quite busy but sushi can be ordered from the tables in the dining room. So an upscale Chinese restaurant, that serves up legit sushi to order, a full bar and respectable wine list with effective service, did I already say that Jazmine is one ambitious restaurant. The good thing is that they actually pull it off, definitely restaurant people in this independently owned restaurant, a gem of a find. 

5 of us ordered family style which started with a small nigiri selection from the sushi bar which included maguro (yellowfin tuna), saba (cured mackerel) and shiro maguro (albacore). All were very legit and priced properly and served with a little modern flair with flecked scallions on the saba and a dot of sriacha on the albacore. We also ordered shrimp siu mai which were large, juicy and delicious and probably one of the best I've had, and I'm from the Bay Area where dim sum joints are plentiful. So the mixture of Japanese sushi and Chinese dumplings as appetizers were an absolute treat, especially with our Columbia Valley Gewurtztraminer, now where else can one start a meal that way? Not many places in my experiences. 

Chinese entrees we shared were: 

Ginger Scallion Beef ($14)Properly textured beef with present ginger and scallion flavors, good rendition. 

Braised Tofu with Black Mushrooms and Vegetables ($12)Okay with the tofu being deep fried then braised. I may have preferred it not fried. Presented in a claypot which was nice. 

Szechuan Snapper ($14) Fillet of Pacific Snapper in a thickish spicy brown sauce. Fish was just ok but drowning in the gloopy sauce. A bad pick in my opinion. 

XO Dried Sauted String Beans ($12) Very properly executed with a little ground pork and garlic, shriveled yet firm beans with just enough sauce to get absorbed into the beans but not pool on the bottom of the dish. 

With some steamed white rice this proved to be a perfect amount for 5 hungry adults. Even though we were all satisfied with the meal thus far we still decided to indulge in a sampling of some dessert with some tea. I mean we were trying to set the tone for the up and coming new year, so bring it on. 

A Coconut Dream Cake was well...dreamy. Very moist layered white cake with a soft coconut cream between the layers was perfect with hot tea. 

A cheesecake which was described as a cherry cheesecake gave me an image of cherries being in the cake but on arrival it was just basic New York cheesecake with that traditional cherry filling topping. Though a decent rendition it was just too ordinary for me. 

A huge dinner for 5 with wine came out to about $130, which is definitely not a bad way to sample a multitude of dishes from different cultures in an upscale setting. To say the least, I'll be back here to celebrate if ever I wanna celebrate up here in Reno. Jazmine is a good find.",1,"good"

I'm from the Bay Area and I visit Reno about a dozen times a year.  I'm Chinese, so even on vacation, I miss the taste of plain steam rice.  I used to eat at Golden Fortune inside the Eldorado Hotel, but I heard the head chef left, and was the head chef at Jazmine's.  I've tried this place several times, and I absolutely love it.  The staff is absolutely amazing.  I don't know if it is because they know me by my first name, but the service has always been perfect.  

The food is great.  For starters, you have to try the crab cakes, the lettuce wraps, and the 5 spice chicken wings (especially if you are having a beer).  The Chef made me salmon cakes one time, it was amazing.  You should ask the waiters to see if the Chef has time to make you an order. I never ordered a soup, but it looks decent.  As for the main course, I love the beef with ginger and scallions, red snapper, baked seabass, Asian spice lamb chops, and the braised pork ribs.  You have to have veges, so I usually get the garlic sauteed vege (whatever is in season) or the egg plant (love egg plant).  I normally get plain steam rice, but if they have dried salted fish, i will ask them to make salted fish fry rice with chicken.

The drinks at this place is good and very reasonably priced.  I am not a big wine guy, but the manager, David, he is like some kind of wine expert.  I had him pick out some wine based off what I was having, and I have to say that the wines he picked out was a great compliment to my meals.  For the real drinks, you have to try their mojitos.  They make a great strawberry mojito when it is in season.  They have all types of beers and their liquor selection is complete.  I am a simple man, my best friend is Heineken, Mojitos when it is hot, and Patron silver when I am hurt (usually after the casinos).

The sushi bar wasn't always there, but I have to say it is a great addition.  I never had their all you can eat sushi deal, but I have ordered a few rolls, and they turned out pretty good.  Their fish is actually fresh, but of course it does not compare to the Bay Area. But for Reno, it is good sushi.

This probably doesn't apply to everyone, but they have good looking hostesses.  Where did these Asian girls come from?  I come to Reno a lot, and I have to say that Wendy (hostess), is the best looking Asian girl that lives in Reno.  I wanted to give this place 4 stars because Wendy has hurt my male ego many times now, I am hoping she will read this and won't turn me down the next time I ask her to marry me. LOL.",2,"good"
