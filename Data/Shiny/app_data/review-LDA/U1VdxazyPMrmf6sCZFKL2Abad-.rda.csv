"2","First - though it's not my duty to comment on other reviews - I'm shocked to see bad reviews of this place!  I've lived within five minutes driving distance of Thai Basil on West Bay for three years, and have eaten there close to three dozen times.  Carry-out and eat-in.  And not ONCE have I had a bad meal there, nor have any of my friends whom I've pointed this direction.

My usual order is cheese rolls for an appetizer, and pad thai with chicken, medium spice.  The cheese rolls are great: something like a fried spring roll but filled with a cream cheese and shrimp mix.  Think of it as Thai crab rangoon, but even tastier.  The rolls are two per order and served with a slightly sweet raspberry-based dipping sauce.  For appetizers, I've also had egg rolls and spring rolls, both of which are good in their own right, but not as memorable as the cheese rolls, mainly for how unique they are.

I've had satay chicken, the red and yellow curry, and pad thai for entrees.  The servings are always generous, served piping hot, and very flavorful.  When eating on location you'll get a bowl of steamed white rice, but that's absent when doing carry out.  I can safely say that I've never missed the rice as the serving size is huge in and of itself, there's really no need.

The decor and ambience of the restaurant is very nice.  It's a casual establishment but done very nicely.  The service has always been fast and friendly, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  I wouldn't call them cheap, but very much in-line for the quality of food and service I've received there.  

I can't say a bad thing about Thai Basil on West Bay Drive and as a long-time customer am really surprised at those who do.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and hopefully the less than perfect experiences are very very few and far between.  New/prospective diners, don't hesitate, just enjoy!

PS: do yourself a favor and order Thai (iced) tea with your meal...you won't regret it!",1,"good"
"3","I was craving for Thai curry so we decided to find a Thai restaurant on GPS and  this place came up.  

The location is not so great....not many things around kind of remote.  When we walked in (like 7:30  dinner time), there were only 2 other groups and we stayed till closing but only 2 others came in after all.  

But then I realized later that this is their second location on the same street.  I wonder why this one came up on GPS and the first one didn't .  The one in Clearwater is so much closer to us.  So maybe the first location is a lot more crowded than this one.  

We had a catapiller roll (eel and avocado on top), Panang Curry, and Seafood delight.  About sushi roll,,,,I wasnt so sure till I tasted.  They are definitely not the best but it was decent (bigger portion than other places too).  It was unfortunate that they did not have regular spicy mayo like other sushi places.  Their spicy mayo looked a lot different and they said that was their spicy mayo.  

Panang Curry is alright not the best again but not bad at all.  The seafood delight is good too...alot of seafood! But the dessert was my most favorite!  Fried banana with coconut ice cream....absolutely delicious!!  I was so full but I wanted a dessert and decided to have this one....so glad i did!!!

The service is not so prompt but they are very nice and I like the interior decoration and the cleanness too.  I still like to try other Thai places around clearwater so I won't be back till later but so far this is my favorite Thai restaurant!",2,"good"
"4","LORD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL! Eating this food made me feel like I was burning in Hell. Knowing my money had gone to waste and that the food tasted awful was enough to make my soul leave my body. 

Curry: Whenever I go to any Thai restaurant the first thing I order is Curry. The thick creamy curry I had come to love was nowhere to be found. What I received was a watery imitation. The 4 star I ordered felt like a 6 star. While dining I felt like crying and calling for my Mama.

Sushi: I ordered the Rock N Roll which is a very basic roll. I thought there was no way they could mess that up, but where there is a will there is a way. They gave me a measly six pieces of sushi which were below average size. I mean Publix made better Sushi. The crispy shrimp was tiny and soggy. I was baffled at this dish. 

Tom Kha: Not only was this soup watery and foul smelling but the mushrooms tasted as if they had been sitting in the garbage for a few days and not edible.

Overall this experience was traumatizing, never again will I ever return to this establishment. I hope they feel guilt and sadness as they lay in their beds. I hope their dreams are of the awful experiences of their victims. I wish they'd be imprisoned and fed their own cooking as punishment (if you could even call it that). Please do not eat here, your life will never be the same.

(Sorry there are no pictures, I burned the food immediately after tasting it)",1,"bad"
"5","Terrible. Bad service, bad food, I understand they were busy . But they were  extremely rude and not attentive to our table at all. We got there at 7 and did not get our salad, soup, or food until 8:15. We found a bone in our sushi and they didn't want to take it off the bill because we ate half of it. The sushi did not taste fresh, my sister did not like her food (which she ordered spicy and was completely sweet with no spice) they just dropped a tray of sauces on the table for her to fix it. We were finally able to talk to a manager and she just kept saying how busy they were but didn't offer to rectify anything. 

We offered to pay for what we ate but did not eat most of the food. The manager went to fix the bill and before she came back the server started viciously clearing off the table. She slammed a plate on top of a plate that was being eaten from (he had is fork in his hand). When I said ""Hey he was eating that, that's one we were going to pay for"", she said ""You people are really nasty"" so we left. This is by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had out to eat. 

I understand they were short staffed and was not expecting too much. I was watching the servers constantly running alcoholic drinks while we sat with empty water glasses for 30 minutes. People getting to go food were treated way nicer than people in the restaurant.",2,"bad"
