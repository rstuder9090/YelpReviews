"2","Let's talk sushi! I personally love the Mexican Roll. 1/2 price sushi is ALL DAY Sun-Thurs and ""All-you-can-eat"" sushi @ the bar ONLY is ALL day Friday & Saturday. If you want Hibachi (the tables where they cook for you)  I would HIGHLY recommend calling in and making reservations ahead of time to ensure your seats; it gets pretty busy. And unfortunately they don't take Sushi bar reservations because there's only what? 26 seats? I mean if your dumb ass reserves 8 seats and you don't come in on time the restaurant looses money by holding your seats for someone who isn't there when there's people that could be sat =( So it makes sense that it's a ""first come- first serve"" policy. Anyways, the filet mignon is to die for @ the Hibachi grill and if you're looking for more bang for the buck try the Dinner Box or the Lunch Box at the sushi bar. It's orgasmic. OH, and don't forget dessert. If you've never had a tempura ice cream you need to try it! DEEP FRIED YUMMINESS. By the way, if you're 21 and up, don't forget to Sake-Bomb it. :) And if you're not into beer like me, try the plum wine. Absolutely love it.",1,"good"

Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!

I have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.

Save room for dessert because their fried green tea ice cream is without a doubt one of my favorite desserts of all time.  You get the fried tempura outside that is warm and crunchy with the refreshing green tea ice cream center... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This place is definitely worth your time, but it does get busy during dinner, especially on the weekends.  So if you have a large group, I would highly recommend calling and making a reservation.  They also have an early bird special with discounts off their hibachi, as long as you get there and order between the hours of 3:00-6:00 PM.",2,"good"
"4","FRANCISCO IS THE WORST CHEF EVER! I've been going to Something Fishy for over 10 years now, and conservatively I'd say that I've been there at least 45 times for dinner, likely much more. I've had Francisco at least a dozen times and have ALWAYS hated the finished product, and his personality stinks. If you frequent here like I do, you know that Francisco doesn't do ANY entertainment at all, aside from the brief volcano in the middle. He rushes to cook the food so he can move on to the next table, inevitably to make more in tips, and tonight my husband's chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Disgusting! After only cooking the rice for approximately 3 min he started spooning it into the bowls to serve it so I kindly asked if he could cook mine a little longer off to the side as he finished cooking the remaining dishes. He was downright rude, and then to make a point he pretty much burnt the rice and refused to cook anything else until my husband finally demanded that he stop trying to burn it and hand it over already! The whole time he was cooking it he had a crappy look on his face and was acting so childish.  What a joke! The rest of my food was hardly cooked and he was incredibly rude the rest of the experience. I will demanded a different chef IF I visit again. He's always been a nightmare of a chef, but tonight he crossed the line. Not to mention that I had my 2 year old daughter with me who adores the fire shows and the tricks with the spatulas, but he didn't do any, and never does. My poor kiddo was so bummed. Why do they keep that guy employed there?! Management, if you are reading this, please monitor his output and offer remedial training! You are losing customers! 
My dinner was horrible tonight, like it is every single time he is the chef. 
Thank God for our waitress who was wonderful! I wish I had caught her name. If it wasn't for her I would have left while Francisco was trying to burn our rice. 
Oh! And to top it off, while in the middle of cooking another chef came over and they took a shot of alcohol while he was (hardly) cooking for us. How unprofessional. This place is becoming a joke. It use to be much better when the original owner, the father of the current owner, was still managing the place. It's falling apart now.",1,"bad"
"5","Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....

We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. 

We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!",2,"bad"
