"2","Let me first start with the fact that when we choose to try a new sushi spot, we do not mess around.  The only thing that I am probably more serious about is soup.  This is why we were extremely pleasantly surprised to find Bleu Sushi nestled away in Center City.  They had no problem accommodating our larger party (7 people to be exact) for our 11-year-old daughter's birthday dinner, Even our family that was visiting from Florida was impressed and asked that we return next time they come to visit.

We started with the scallops and shiitakes, salmon oshinko, and a salmon skin salad (I have a slight obsession with salmon skin).  The scallops were cooked perfectly and dredged in a beautiful savory sauce, but the mushrooms were even better.  The consistency is what made them so amazing, not too firm and not too soft, and piping hot.  They were easily my favorite thing we had all night, and if i could simply get pounds of these mushrooms cooked this way, I would come here every single day, just for them.  The salmon oshinko was actually very interesting, not something we had tried anywhere before, but was recommended by our server, so we thought we'd try it.  It had a very nice smoky salmon flavor, almost like nova lox, and went really well with the other vegetables that were wrapped up with it.  Then there was the salmon skin...  not anything spectacular or different, but it was a ton of salmon skin, which is exactly what I wanted, and it was presented in a nice semi-sweet glaze which made it hard to not eat all of it before anyone else had any.

Out of the seven of us ,only my youngest daughter does not eat sushi, so she had chicken teriyaki, while the rest of us ordered a large sushi boat, which blew the birthday girl away.  Her teriyaki was perfect and was nice and tender with a good amount of sauce, with really nice sticky rice and seared veggies on the side.  The boat was huge and a ton of care was put into the presentation, complete with some glowing cubes that really caught her attention.  I don't remember every roll that we ordered for the boat, but the ones that really jumped out at me were the Temple, Villanova, Ten street, and Drexel rolls.  There were a couple more, but I don't remember what they were.  They were all fantastic, super fresh, and different.  Each one was unique in its own way, with the Temple and Villanova being similar, but it was the Villanova that really blew me away.  It seemed to be a nicely-sized spicy tuna roll, but is topped with salmon that is garnished with fresh cracked black pepper and then seared with a torch till it has wonderful crispy brown edges.  Not only did it have a great smoky, crispy flavor and texture, but it filled the restaurant with this amazing scent of grilled fish; something neither I or Jen had seen done anywhere before.  Honestly, it is worth visiting Bleu Sushi simply for this roll, or maybe two or three orders of this roll.  Pair this with those mushrooms from the scallop dish, and I would be in heaven.

We were barely able to finish all the food we had ordered but the staff came out of left field and had a small cake for our older daughter and gave everyone else at the table assorted ice cream dishes as part of the birthday celebration.  This was really nice and really made her night.  Everything here was great and we will definitely be returning here in the future.  If you are around the Jefferson hospital area and want a great Japanese meal, check out Bleu Sushi, you will definitely not be disappointed!",1,"good"
"3","Creative, amazingly delicious and fresh sushi.  Have gone here for years -- mostly taking advantage of their great lunch specials but now and then for a lovely setting for dinners.  Now in Covid take-out mode, I placed pretty large order easily on-line and it was ready very quickly.  They called to let me know and to see if I had any questions about pick up.  They use an intriguing robotic arm -- lit up in blue neon -- which passes your order to you out their front windows.  It's a gimmick, I'll grant you, because a human touched the bags to pack them and put them onto the arm in the first place so not really contactless except you are standing further apart.  It's fun to watch; seems a pricy solution but glad they are making the effort.  Caveat: Manager should wear mask properly -- it was dangling well below the nose and he was talking over the top of it, defeating the whole purpose of the mask. That could cause people some discomfort in feeling their order and food have not had covid virus breathed onto it while packing up. (He sets the standard for the rest of the staff, afterall. If they are semi-masked up front, what's going on in the kitchen?)  Still, if they can pull up their socks (er, masks) on that issue, this is a great take out option.  (Wish I could post photos, but we ate everything too quickly!)  Spent $92 for 3 people including tip and felt it was pricey but worth it; depending how and what you order, you could spend much less.",2,"good"
"4","My first visit to Philadelphia came along with a craving for some good sushi. After a long day of doing typical center-city Philly touring, I finally got my boyfriend to agree to try sushi for the first time. He is the pickiest of picky eaters (both by personal preference and because of allergies), so I knew I needed to pick a really good place. Trusting my always faithful Yelp! app, I found Bleu. Granted, it wasn't my first choice (the place I wanted to go to had a gap between lunch and dinner), but it was held in high regards. Fellow Yelpers seemed to rave about this place, so I thought it was worth a try considering the circumstances. 

We walked here from the Independence Hall Center, and it took us about 15 minutes. The outside of the building isn't too much to rave about, considering we almost missed it. It is, however a blue door, with blue-framed windows and small sign that reads Bleu. Go figure. We walked in to a completely empty restaurant. Its a really small place, pretty much just a strip of booths and a center walkway with the actual sushi making station at the back. We were asked if we had a reservation, which seemed odd because the place was completely empty with the exception of the staff. We informed the server wearing Nike sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that we did not, but we were seated immediately anyway. 

I was quite confused throughout the entire meal service. You have a very trendy, upscale looking restaurant that lives up to the name of Bleu (because literally everything inside is a blue color), yet you have servers and employees that are half dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt yet the other half wearing slacks and a black button down shirt? I didn't know if we were underdressed or just fitting in? Ok.. 

Anyhow, we took a look at the menu, and their prices are typical of sushi joints of the same caliber. Please keep in mind that sodas are served by the can! Prices are around $5-$6 for regular rolls, $4-$5 for nigiri, and $10-$15 for specialty rolls. Being the picky eater he is, my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken ($13) as a fallback and I decided for us to share the Rittenhouse roll, the traditional Philly roll (when in Rome), and the Ten Street roll. 

The Philly roll was the most unedible of them all. It was mainly just mealy and mushy cucumber wrapped into a roll with a teeny bit of salmon and cream cheese. The cucumber was unpleasantly overbearing and left a funny taste in your mouth. Unfortunately, it was the first item my boyfriend tasted, and it made him weary to try anything else. I convinced him to try the rest. The Rittenhouse Square roll was okay at best. It would have been much better if the sprinkling of herbs/seasoning on top was omitted from the recipe. It was honestly a clash of flavors and made the roll taste awkward and out of place. The Town roll was the one that we both enjoyed the most out of the three. Don't be fooled. Just because we liked it the most out of the three doesn't mean it was actually good. It was the most edible. It seemed just like Albacore tuna from a can was dried out, put into a roll and deep fried. Slap some spicy mayo on top and you've just made yourself the Town roll. It was very crunchy, even for a deep-fried roll (almost like the consistency of a Dorito), and was difficult to chew. 

Service was nearly nonexistent. The only time they really came to check on us was once when my water glass was refilled. At the end of the meal service they brought us two complimentary ice cream samples. They were about the size of a tablespoon each and were a vanilla/peanut butter mixture- very odd for a sushi place to be offering peanut butter ice cream after a meal service? 

Anyhow, the bill came out to around $51 dollars, and after tip it it was close to around $65. In my personal opinion, this is a very hefty price to pay for sub-par sushi and non existent service. Lesson learned I guess. I'm almost embarrassed that I brought my boyfriend there for his first sushi experience, because it was that un-enjoyable. I'm from the Phoenix, AZ area where sushi is known to be less than favorable, and I have had better from some places in my neighborhood.",1,"bad"
"5","Ugh- this review might piss people off.  I came here after a friend recommended it and was super stoked to try it out.  I even read reviews before arriving (in true Yelper form) and was even more thrilled about my reservation because of the 4 and 5 star write ups.  My experience was not pleasant.  Not even close.  The service was bad and the food was mediocre at best.  

Reservations were for a Friday night.  With wine in tow, I arrived, opened the door and was immediately standing over someone's entree.  Cool. As my date and I stood there waiting to be seated I felt like I was in some weird basement sushi frat party. Tightly packed with zero elbow room.  Dimly lit with weird purple/blue lighting but not dark enough that I didn't notice the metal folding chairs at the tables. What? Metal folding chairs? Is this a 4th of July picnic at weird Aunt Nancy's crib in Northeast Philly? 

Once we were seated and I was finished judging the interior, I decided to put it all behind me and focus on the food -which, I had plenty of time to do since our order wasn't taken for about 20+ minutes.  Finally, once we got some attention, we decided going sharesies with a few regular rolls and two specialty rolls: the Temple Roll and Ten Street roll.  The Temple had spicy yellowtail, tempura flakes wrapped in black peppered seared white tuna with some sweet sauce. It was good but nothing exceptional- and, sadly, it was the better of the two special rolls we ordered.  

Wait, TWO special rolls? Yes. This is the conversation I had to have with the waitress since only one was brought out.  Once the order was finally corrected our Ten Street roll arrived and it looked unappetizing.  On the menu its described as deep fried tuna, salmon, yellowtail and white fish, finished with unagi sauce, massgo, scallion and spicy mayo.  Should be described as: gross.  It was overcooked and I could definitely taste the old (and probably unchanged) oil from their fryer.   I normally stay far away from cooked maki rolls but I've had some pretty stellar deep fried rolls in my time and this one didn't even come close.  It was foul.  Aside from being burnt and small, it tasted like Bumblebee canned tuna and was smothered in sauces. Needless to say, after waiting 30 minutes for it after we placed our original order- I was peeved. 

During our dinner service was inattentive. Maybe it was because the restaurant was busy or perhaps they were all in the back putting out what smelled like a small grease fire for the last 15 minutes of our meal complete with smoke that started to make its way into the dining room. More burnt Ten Street canned Bumblebee tuna rolls for everyone?",2,"bad"
