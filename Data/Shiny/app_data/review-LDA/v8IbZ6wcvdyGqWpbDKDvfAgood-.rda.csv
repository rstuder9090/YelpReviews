"2","As other Yelpers have mentioned this is a great concept and the first of its' kind in Tampa. The tapas\sushi conveyor belt idea is fun and interesting. All of the bubble saucer plates, shouts from the cooks, ""Yo Yo"", put us into sensory overload. If you are an indecisive person this is not the restaurant for you. The plates of sushi and other dishes swirl at  a fast pace. I grabbed at least 2 plates on impulse. Bring a calculator because each plate is a different price based on color. For example the green plate is 3 dollars and the yellow plate is 7 dollars ( I wonder if color blind people pay more because of this). Breakdown of some of items  that I tried:

Iced Green Tea: Matcha based, excellent quality, and free refils: 5/5
California Roll (purple plate): Average flavor not real crab I have had better at most resturants: 2/5
Black Sesame Dorayaki (purple plate) Love the raspberry sauce, great sesame flavor, ate 2 plates: 5/5
Chicken Fire Cracker Rice (orange plate): Decent well seasoned, not spicy, not much chicken: 3.5/5
Chicken Katsu (orange plate): Solid choice, good sauce, fair portion: 4/5

In the future I will avoid the sushi and order more hot entrees. I enjoyed most of the chicken dishes. For lunch with tip my wife and I payed just under $50.00 dollars and were still hungry. Next time I will control my impulses and study the menu more before grabing plates.",1,"good"
"3","Yo! Sushi is a totally new concept for Tampa. It's conveyor-belt sushi also known as kaiten-sushi or kaiten-zushi or sushi-go-round in Japan. You sit at a booth and grab the sushi you want and pay at the end.

My first experience with this kind of sushi was in San Francisco when I first tried sushi as a 5-year old at Isobune Sushi in Japantown and I have longed for a conveyor-belt style sushi place to come to Tampa since I moved here in 1999. Yo! Sushi is finally making that a reality.

The style of Yo! Sushi is modern and different from Isobune. The focus is on fast, fresh, and convenient and the setup of the place follows this focus. When you walk-up to the restaurant it's open and easy to get a seat at. Call-buttons are placed at each table to make it easy to get service and close your check.

Sushi is constantly being rolled and made by the sushi chefs at the restaurant and the open-kitchen let's you watch the chefs in action. I have faith a high-traffic area like the International Plaza will help ensure the freshness of the fish at Yo! Sushi. 

Plates range from $3-$6 and contain a variety of cooked and raw sushi, cooked Japanese food, and dessert. There's a little bit of something for everyone depending on your tastes. 

One of my favorite things I have tried so far is the Chicken Katsu Curry which comes a small plate with rice below and about 5 cuts of katsu for $5. I often want to order katsu at restaurants, but find it hard to justify spending $15 on dinner for one - especially when I also want sushi with my food and end up just ditching the katsu. This meets me halfway.

As far as the sushi is concerned - it tastes fresh and is certainly above what you would find at a buffet or something like Koizi/Saki Endless Sushi. It's not quite the highest quality of sushi which is understandable considering the price and focus, but still satisfactory to me for the taste. Most of the sushi leans towards salmon, tuna, and imitation crab/crab special or California Roll-creations. 

I also liked the Popcorn Shrimp (tastes more like Bang Bang Shrimp), Takoyaki (hard to find a decent one in Tampa for sure!), and the Kimchi Salmon Steamed Bun (bun was just right and salmon pretty good quality!). There are plenty of things to try though so repeat visits will need to be made!

For me, Yo! Sushi is great for a quick and tasty meal when I'm in a rush and don't necessarily want to spend as much time/money at a regular Japanese sushi restaurant. I can see how someone who wants a really high-end Japanese experience may not approve, but then one should also consider price and time into factors of that justification.

The service is friendly/approachable and the managers clearly really love working for Yo! Sushi which is something plenty of restaurants in Tampa Bay seem to lack and may come from them being an international company.

Definitely check it out even if it's just to try something new for fun with some friends or family. I know I'll be back often!",2,"good"
