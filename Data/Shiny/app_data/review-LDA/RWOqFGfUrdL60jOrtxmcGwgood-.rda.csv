First, it's located behind a winn-dixie shopping center and right next door to a pizza spot (which has pretty good pizza, btw). It's truly a ""hole in the wall"" gem. The servers are very sweet and they are pretty attentive most of the time. The sushi chefs greet you as you walk in and thank you as you leave. And if you go there a few times, they'll remember your name. 

Now the important stuff: the sushi! The freshest, best tasting sushi around. If you are a tuna fan, Osaka will be your favorite place too! The tuna is so fresh and so flavorful. The regular rolls are above average but their specialty rolls are what separate this place from any other restaurant. My favorites: Tuna tornado, Oo la la, sexy man, and the crunch rolls. Try any and you will not be disappointed!! Yes, the sushi takes a little longer than a lot of other places, but once you see how beautifully it's presented and the quality of what's placed in front of you, you'll understand why. It's worth the wait!

The non-sushi menu also has great options: delicious crab rangoon, chicken fried rice, and peanut sauce amazing. But to be honest, if you're here, you should get the sushi!",1,"good"
"3","Can't say much more than has already been said, this is the place to get good consistent sushi.  Very friendly service, and once they see you a few times they call out your name as soon as you walk in the door.  I've been going to Osaka for years, and I've never been disappointed, they have a great sushi menu and Thai menu.  There's enough selection on the menu to satisfy most people that aren't big sushi fans.  

The specialty sushi roll menu is huge, many original selections and combinations, though I would call these rolls, ""American Sushi"".  They also have a traditional sushi menu, and if you sit at the sushi bar on a slow evening, and they know you, they will let you come up with your own custom roll !  One of my favorite rolls is the ""Sexy Man"" along with the ""Fat Bastard #2"" yes these are real names of their rolls. 

About the only thing I could critique is the time to get your sushi order can take over 30 minutes on a really busy evening.  Still way worth the wait, and it gives you an excuse to order more sake !  

They're going to be moving at the end of September because the strip center is being torn down for a big CVS, because there's not enough of them around.  It's probably a blessing in disguise because the current location decor is due for a upgrade.",2,"good"
