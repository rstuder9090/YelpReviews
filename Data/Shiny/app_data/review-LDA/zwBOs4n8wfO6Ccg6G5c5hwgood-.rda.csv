"2","Came to Florida for a business trip and being a sushi fan I wanted to try this place out. I came during late night happy hour and I felt like I walked into a lounge. The lights were dimmed and the music was bumpin'. Upon walking in the first I thing I see is the hostess desk and behind them a large bar with seating on three sides. I thought it was pretty neat. Anyways, the restaurant has different sections for seating; one for the regular menu, another section for hibachi, and then the other side for some more regular menus. Did I mention that late night happy hour is half off sushi, drinks and apps! 

FYI: If you're looking for a nice, quiet eat your food and go, place this isn't it. Beware that service may be slow but the food is on point!

I started the night with a tall glass of Sangria with a shot of Grand Marnier. I love GM in Sangrias!  If you haven't tried it yet, it is a MUST TRY DRINK! The bartender that night made it to perfection, not too fruity not too bland. I think I had about 3 or 4 before I ended the night.

For app we tried to spicy tuna volcano which was mmm mmm good the heat was mild and the sauce was oh soo yummy. I loved the slices of jalapenos, so if you're into spicy I suggest trying this.

For my main dish I had the volcano roll... this was not 8 pieces but like 10 or 12! The inside was California roll and on top was a bunch of crab meat and spicy mayo all over. 

Paying half the price was pretty much worth it. Next time I'm in Florida I'll be ordering this all over again.",1,"good"
"3","Best Sushi I've found in town!  We don't live anywhere near Hiro's, but we pass quite a few other Sushi places along the way to eat at Hiro's.  We haven't tried the Japanese Steak House side of the place so I can't comment on that yet, but the sushi is outstanding.

Our favorite items include:
- Seaweed Salad - It's pretty much like any other place's good seaweed salad, but I have to have it every time I go for Sushi.
- Beef Tataki - an interesting slightly spicy recipe of rare seared (almost raw) beef
- Hiros Roll - any roll named after the restaurant better be good and this one does not disappoint.  Slightly sweet, not spicy
- Tempura TNT Roll - Spicy tuna, some other good stuff, spicy sauces, and the whole roll is Tempura deep fried
- Sexy Roll - Can't remember what's in this one, but it's great - trust me!  This is also one of the milder rolls. 
- Lollipop Roll - very mild - a great roll to end on and get the spicy rolls off your pallete when you're finished)

I haven't tried the Volcano yet, but I saw one and it looked great!

You cannot go wrong with the more expensive rolls on the menu.  I'm not a cheapskate when it comes to Sushi, so we haven't bothered to try their California Rolls, Tampa Rolls, or other simple items.  We always go for the good stuff and we were not disappointed.

They're open really late, and after 10pm all the Sushi is half price!  If we could wait that long to go out, it would be an outstanding deal.",2,"good"
