"2","I've never gotten sick from eating at Rusan's, so I can't relate to a lot of the other reviewers.

That being said, I LOVE Rusan's! It is by far THE hippest/swankiest sushi joint in Nashville - I would definitely take out of town friends here on a weekend night to give them a good impression of Nashville.  However, there is always a long wait, and you can't really do much in the vicinity while you're waiting.  It's definitely a hole in the wall, which can be great, but waiting in your car in the gravel parking lot for 1.5 hours since there's nothing else close to it COULD be a little more exciting.  

Now, on to the food...

Everything is reasonably priced, but the atmosphere is 1/2 of the experience.  Yes, it's true that you may not be able to hear anybody in your party talking on a Fri. or Sat. night, but who cares?!  You're here to gawk at the gorgeous 20-somethings that flood the place around 8-9 pm, not to have an intimate conversation.  The staff puts on a ridiculous show whenever somebody does sake bombing, and if it's somebody's birthday, well, i won't ruin the surprise...ok actually I will: my friend's birthday there resulted in both of us being forced to dance on top of our table w/ a complete stranger while being served a jazzed up twinkie for dessert.  TWINKIES AT A SUSHI RESTAURANT?!?!

Their menu is laughably long, with everything from cilantro-flavored 'tiger beef' to innovative rolls like the cranberry roll and a million others I can't remember.  I once accidentally ordered completely raw beef, and the waiter took it back and gave me something else with no complaints.  Last time I was there you could get a discount on the lunch buffet if you went after they stopped making fresh rolls.

Overall, I think Rusan's is the perfect prelude to a concert/night on the town.  The food is good enough in itself, but the trendy atmosphere and beautiful patrons make the potentially long wait worthwhile.",1,"good"
"3","RuSan's offers adequate food with reasonable prices. I have been there twice in the past three years and found the food & service to be consistent each time. The buffet is filling with an assortment of fried & seafood sushi rolls, noodles, fried rice, calamari, four other selected dishes of the day, Vegetarian Inaka Miso Udon soup, salad, & lightly fried banana rolls. If you do not care for the buffet there is an extensive menu of your favorite Japanese cuisine(s).

Very Important Tip #1: Please note to NOT waste food from the buffet or you will be charged for what you do not eat. There is a sign posted on the buffet & the server was kind enough to inform us as well. 

Tip #2: The weekday Buffet is best to get there before 1:00 pm. 

Tip #3: The parking meters in front of RuSan only allows 1 hour intervals for a maximum amount of $1.00. Bottom line save your change as the meter will only count up to $1.00 & anything more it will just take it. 

Now to the physical condition of the restaurant. The restaurant is as clean as it gets as I witnessed them disinfecting, sweeping, & mopping. However in all honesty this restaurant could use a makeover/renovation/upgrade. The plates and silverware are scratched, the floor is scuffed, the green tea kettle appeared dingy, the female restroom has two stalls with one missing a door, and the buffet equipment is worn & outdated. 

Take some comfort that RuSan's has a 97 health rating as of September 2015 that is visible in the front of the restaurant. 

The ambience, decor, cleanliness, quality of the food, & service are very important to me and that can make or break my overall dining experience. They did change their music (thank goodness) to more pop & classic rock genres. 

Four generous stars as this restaurant has the potential of being a five restaurant however; needs major improvements in the areas mentioned above sooner than later.",2,"good"
