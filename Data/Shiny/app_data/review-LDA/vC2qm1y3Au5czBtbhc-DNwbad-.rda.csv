"2","I came to Sushi Teri because of the great reviews I've seen online. I literally arrived less than 3 hours after stepping off the plane and it did not disappoint.

Being by myself I just sat down at the sushi bar and simply asked the sushi chef for recommendations. He highly recommended the halibut and yellow tuna that evening so I started with 2 pieces of Nigiri with the Halibut. It was so incredibly good and I wish I could remember the name of the sauce he drizzled on it. It was just divine.

I then asked for a recommendation on a roll with tuna and / or salmon and he high recommended the Crunchy Roll. Salmon, Tuna, Cream Cheese, rice and then dropped into a fryer. Sliced and served with a nice stacked presentation.

The salmon looked so amazing in the glass, I decided to finish off with 2 more pieces of Nigiri with the Salmon. Again, excellent. As I sat there I watched the chefs prepare multiple rolls and each looked awesome. The entire meal was much more reasonable than I expected. 

Highly highly recommend Sushi Teri if you're in the area. There's parking on the street and there's actually a fairly large public parking lot behind the restaurant as well. The entrance to the parking lot is a few doors past Sushi Teri on Linden Avenue on the left.",1,"good"
"3","Will you be having the best sushi of your life here?  Probably not.  But, will you undoubtedly have a good time?  Hell yes!
Recently renovated, Sushi Teri boasts a large dining room, several booths, sushi bar, and beverage bar.  The staff there is extremely accommodating and the service is speedy.
I've been here several times, the last trip being the best by far.  I've had date nights here, and as enjoyable as they may be, the sushi itself lacked the excitement necessary to spice up a date night.  However, my last dining experience here was with a large group of friends.  We ordered some simple rolls and a few sake bombs.  We invited the chef to have a drink with us, thinking there was no way he'd join.  A few rolls and several sake bombs in, the chef traipsed out of the kitchen to partake.  Too bad we had just finished all of our alcohol :-(
Point being, the ambience and staff provide for an excellent time.  As we delved deeper into drunkenness, we became more adventurous in our sushi choices.  The specialty rolls, albeit a smaller selection than hoped for, are delicious!  Fittingly, don't leave without trying the Carpinteria roll! Yum.",2,"good"
"4","Went here last night with co-workers. One of the ladies in our group of three is pregnant and a vegetarian, she is a good sport when she is with us meat eaters and ordered the vegetarian special. I notice this whining sound eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! I realize its the sound coming from the refrigeration unit and think to myself, ""this cant be good"" but just let it go.

 When they bring our vegetarian her soup we ask if it was the soup for the vegetarian platter and the lady said ""yes"", and looked at us crazy, we then asked if the soup had meat in it and she said  ""yes the soup has fish in it"" She then looked at us like we were crazy for asking why  they would serve that with the vegetarian special?? To save us from having to explain it too her I just traded my salad for her soup and went on. Well then after maybe a moment of the soup and salad arriving they brought the rest of the food at once. The staff is poorly trained and don't seem to enjoy their work. Timing a meal to make sure people get the App then salad then entr√©e, so the customer can enjoy it - that would be something you would expect from a waiter or waitress. This place only has only food runners with little to no personality and no real care for the customer. They bring you food from the kitchen and drop it on the table and don't come back to see how its going, if all is well, etc. 

We ordered 2 of the special apps one was fish cheeks with jalapeno and the other was a salmon dish. The fish was not cold and was a little gamey. I remembered the fridge, eeeeeeeeeee! and we decided that we would move forward. I had the tempura and teriyaki  chicken special that came with 6 California rolls. The chicken was in small bits served in a tin foil bowl? on the side of the plate little to no seasoning and NO teriyaki sauce. I had to ask for a side of sauce. the tempura was ok two shrimp and plenty of veggies. California rolls had a strong mayo taste.

After sitting there with the bill and waiting for people in our group to finish the food runner came by and asked if the bill was filled out and we said yes and she says ""can I have it?"" which as an ex waiter for about 12 years is a bit rude. The place was not full I saw at least 5 open tables so there was no need to do this. Here is a tip for you ""food runner"", once you drop the bill you only have to come every once in a while and ask if we  need water. The bill is there, when we leave then you get it. Anyway she asks for the bill and then walks away no thank you, good bye, kiss my butt, nothing.

Long story short, skip this place, if the food doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth the non existent service will.",1,"bad"
"5","This is the worst restaurant in Carpinteria, second only to Ihop. I have come here because there is no other sushi restaurant and my kids used to like it as a change of scene.

We walked in tonight and the place is empty. It smells like the restroom.
I have been in the restaurant biz for over 20 years. I am used to seeing a certain flow and the way the staff  go about their jobs is so disorganized. This place is obviously not well managed as the inexperienced staff have no training They make each staff member independent of each other so that on any given night you can have three servers come and ask to take your order. On the ticket, instead of a server's name, it just says ""manager."" The servers are mostly indifferent. They will bring out the food without concern for who ordered it, if the patrons have basic utensils, etc. I often order miso soup and 9 times out of 10 the server carries it in hand with their thumb on the rim. Many people sip from the rim of this kind of bowl. They usually forget to bring something ordered.
One can go to Vons and get just about anything that tastes fresher. If you like frozen beef or chicken that is heated in a microwave and smothered with store bought teriyaki goop, then this place is for you! The sushi looks authentic but for me, the success of a sushi restaurant is freshness of the seafood. They use the lowest grade of fish and the color, odor and taste is not what one sees in a good sushi restaurant.
The staff spend an inordinate amount of time doing side-work (consolidating soy sauce) instead of paying attention to customers.
For me it is an extremely MEDIOCRE dining place.",2,"bad"
