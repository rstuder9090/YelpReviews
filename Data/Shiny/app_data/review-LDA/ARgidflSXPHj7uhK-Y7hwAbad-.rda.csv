"2","I am a little confused with the reviews. As 'the best sushi place in CWE', isn't the sushi supposed to be the best? 

It should be first emphasized that 'sushi' here refers to the traditional sushi as opposed to the rolls which in no way reflect the sushi quality and authenticity, conceding the fact that these rolls somehow resemble Makizushi. 

Sushi: 2/5, disappointment. Our assessment started from the Nigirizushi (hand-pressed sushi). Apparently it was not well pressed. When I tried to pickup the first sushi, it fell apart. I was also stunned by the sushi preparers' lack in fundamental knowledge such as condiments for different seafood (Amaebi is supposed to be served with grated ginger; grated ginger and sliced scallions accompany mackerel; scallop works better with sea salt and citrus, etc.) None of these happened. 

Ama Ebi (4/5): Botan shrimp took place in their amaebi sushi for its redundancy than the original Alaskan amaebi. As expected, it had less concentrated sweetness and weaker sweet aftertaste. On the plus side, the complimentary deeply fried shrimp head was crispy and the shrimp brain was a delicacy. 

Hotate (2/5): Scallops were lower in glycogen and thus sweetness less perceivable and also somehow losing the fresh texture. One hotate sushi was a failure because the sushi preparer broke the flat cylindrical muscle in half when it was butterflied. Poor preparation due to negligence. 

Saba(5/5): Very rich in omega-3 oil healthy fish, my personal favorite. Their mackerel was rightly cured and still preserved aromas of the mackerel and left it with less fishy oil. Nice job! 

Chirashizushi and Tekkadon 3/5: Very few pieces of small cuts of Sashimi in a huge bowl. I expected to see fish cut into a block shape about 1 to 1.5 inches thick, 3.5 wide. Here it was thin-sliced to translucent pieces. Chirashi often varies regionally but at least 2 slices of salmon and tuna are the baseline. I saw only one piece of salmon. Although tuna are usually thinner, the Tekkadon tuna here was so sheer, light and transparent like diaphanous films. The quality was not bad but they are overpriced. 
-----------------
Appetizer 4/5: We had Grilled Squid and Tempura. The tempura dipping sauce was great. The grilled squid was a bit overcooked and chewy but the sweet Teriyaky sauce with sesame was a delightful surprise.

Ambiance 5/5:  It is a very well decorated neat little place. A lovely restaurant. Quite and stress free. They even have one washitsu, a Japanese-style room having tatami flooring and other traditional architectural features. We were glad to see otoro on the menu, superior quality tuna highly perishable, and uni. 

Service 3/5: We ordered two Saba Nigiri but only got one. We had the second one after we asked the hostess to double check the order. Later she forgot to include a pen in our bill. 

As a medium to upper scale restaurant with the price to back it up, this establishment could train their employees to be more professional and staff more mindful of their guests. No amount of interior design or upholstery can make up for mediocre sushi.",1,"good"
"3","God I love this place. I'm writing an update for a few reasons. The first is that I recently tried their tofu Nigiri, and it is as good as everything I've ever tried from there. It's not how you would expect tofu to be, which I feel is worth mentioning. It's not a big hunk of curd, but rather is more like a flat square strip of tofu that they wrap around a chunk of rice, and they must marinate it in something delicious because it comes out tasting sweet and scrumptious. 

Another reason for me writing this update (and perhaps the most pressing) is that I tried Kampai for lunch one day within the past month, and I was VERY happy with my experience. It was the day after a big snow, but I had promised someone sushi lunch, so I had to deliver on that promise. We were the only people in the place, and the server (who is one of my favorites) commented on our loyalty, which made me smile. 

She also brought my guest and I a special complimentary appetizer, which was delicious. It was a lightly fried rectangle of tofu in a delightfully sweet teriyaki sauce with a slice of avocado on top. It was delicious, and I found it amusing as well that we go here so often that our server knew that at least one of us is a vegetarian. I also wanted to say that I don't know if she gave us a free appetizer because we are such loyal (and regular) customers, or because we were the only people brave enough to venture out to Kampai for lunch on a snow day. Either way, it was very appreciated, and definitely made my guest and I feel like they really valued us as customers. 

Okay...enough rambling. The real REAL reason I wrote this update is due to the excellence of what I got for lunch. I got a Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura combo Bento box, and it was absolutely outstanding. It was basically some delicious teriyaki chicken served on a bed of lettuce with a healthy serving of teriyaki sauce, a bunch of tempura fried veggies (flat sweet potato squares, onions, shrimp, etc), this delicious teriyaki like potato concoction, a healthy portion of white rice, and 4 pieces of California roll. All this awesomeness for only around $13...I was definitely impressed, and left feeling very, very full. I'm glad the appointment I had had was cancelled, because otherwise I definitely would have missed it, as it took me more than an hour to consume all of this delicious food. This experience just helped to further solidify my love for this place, and made me want to go back for lunch sometime very soon.

Two more quick notes, and then I'm finished. Promise. 

Note 1: Plum wine! Oh my god, it is so delicious and sweet...I have gotten it every time I've been there since I first tried it...including on this lunchtime jaunt.

Note 2: This place seems to be getting more popular (the word seems to be getting out) and I couldn't be happier. I want nothing but the best for these people, because they clearly know what they are doing and deserve success. Arrigato!",2,"good"
"4","I seem to be in disagreement with most Yelpers in regard to this restaurant.

The food isn't horrible. Actually, it is.

We were served complimentary soup and salad. The miso soup had a rather salty aftertaste and lacked tofu. I'm normally a fan of Asian sesame dressing on salad however their dressing was very sour - probably saturated with vinegar. 

I ordered tempura for an app and donkatsu for my main course. The tempura arrived quickly but the batter on the shrimp was limp. The sauce left much to be desired as it was barely sweet (like most tempura sauce). I've had better and cheaper tempura elsewhere such as Sushi Ai and I am not a fan of that place. The 5 dollar price tag on it also added to my dismay.

The donkatsu arrived rather fast also but it was likewise a disappointment. It included 2 small cutlets of pork served upon a HUGE plate of vegetables including broccoli, carrots, onions and cabbage. The vegetables had seasoning on it but it tasted bland. It seemed to be heated up from an assorted frozen bag. The cabbage tasted bleak and I was done with it after a small nibble.

The Katsu is a staple of Japanese food. It can be served with curry or more commonly, with a side of a sweet katsu fruit sauce. Kampai's katsu was fried well (a little on the dry side) and it tasted a little below average. It certainly was not bad and was enough to fill me up however the 15.50 price tag was certainly not worth it.

I expected the bill to be 20-21 however upon receiving the check, I noticed my total to be 27.50. Kampai added the gratuity in the total without any consent. Tax and the ""forced"" tip accumulated my bill an extra 6 dollars.I was not overthrilled by the food I received and the inflated check added even more to my feelings towards this place.

Upon paying the bill, I received the receipt back for a signature. Surprise, below the total was a blank line for ""Additional Tip"". The friends I came with all agreed that this was unnecessary and went along to sign the bottom to finalize what we had to pay for the overpriced food.

I'm aware this place is $$, but let me put this into your perspective. I had one appetizer and one entree - 27.50. My friend and his gf shared a check and they paid 47 for 3 rolls and a couple pieces of sushi. Another friend split a check with someone else and paid 74. Both of them complained of being hungry shortly after as well. Another person in my party ordered one crunch roll and paid 11. 

Nope, never again. 

Kampai seems to have stellar reviews but the sub-par food and insanely overpriced food will keep me from visiting this establishment ever again.",1,"bad"
"5","Based on all the previous reviews, I had high hopes for Kampai... maybe it was just an off night, but I was pretty underwhelmed. Options for sushi at 8pm on a Sunday night are pretty limited, which is how my friend Ben and I ended up here in the first place. 

We started by ordering teriyaki chicken and drinks off the cocktail menu. The chicken was really good, but the drinks came in the smallest martini glasses I've ever seen, and Ben described his as ""what I imagine battery acid must taste like, mixed with orange peel and cloves"". It was actually pretty hilarious to watch him attempt to drink it, but nobody like to spend $5 on a nasty, tiny drink. 

After we put in our sushi order they brought us miso soup and salads. It's nice that these are included with your meal, but their ginger dressing wasn't great so I didn't eat much of my salad. Ben got a Fire Dragon roll, some piece of sashimi that I can't recall, and something that looked like an ice cream cone of raw fish. This was hilarious, as he didn't realize that's what it was and had to google how to eat it (the correct answer was, apparently, just like an ice cream cone). I got a Spider roll, which was good, but fell apart when I tried to pick it up, so I ended up with a giant mess. We had each ordered a vegetable roll, and realized halfway through that we didn't receive them... by this point we were kind of just ready to get out of there, so we didn't mention it. They didn't appear on the bill thankfully, but we were kinda bummed we didn't get them. 

The staff was nice, but it seemed like there were tons of them just hanging out (with all of about 10 customers in the whole place, if even). It was overall just an odd experience and I left feeling like my sushi craving was less than satisfied. Oh, and Ben would like to give a shout out to the cute girl in the red sweater (he developed quite the crush).",2,"bad"
