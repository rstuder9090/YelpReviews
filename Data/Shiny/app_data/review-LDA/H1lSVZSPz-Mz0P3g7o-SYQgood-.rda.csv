"2","4.5 STARS! This relatively new sushi bar & Japanese grill is a WONDERFUL addition to the Lutz area. Its interior is clean, fresh, & modern. The reclaimed natural redwood from the San Francisco Bay area is GORGEOUS! 

There's a beverage bar (yes, alcohol), a sushi bar, tables & chairs separated by plexiglass, three larger more secluded padded booths, & many tables taking center stage on the dining room floor. Service was fast & friendly; Adeline C. was especially good. The thick wooden menus are sanitized after each use & sealed. 

According to the menu, ""Zukka-San represents an elevated experience & expanded menu from the first Zukku-San started from a humble 350 sq foot stall inside Tampa's Amateur Works Food Hall. The towering wood patterns of ""Koi"" fish swimming against a sea of waves were meticulously designed & carved by a local artist."" L00K UP to see all the Koi! Truly an aestetically-pleasing restaurant!

There are 17 ""Masterpiece Sushi Rolls"" available. Our Sunset Roll @ $12.95 w/ real crab, Ahi tuna, cucumber, avocado, & cilantro (etc.) was EXCELLENT. The waitress stated that the Dancing Dragon @ $13.95 is a patron favorite. It includes Spicy Ahu tuna, tempura shrimp, tuna, scallions, spicy mayo, & eel sauce, etc. (We returned for it two days later; it was VERY GOOD!)

"3","So excited to have this sushi restaurant in the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area. Located across from the Tampa outlets. The restaurant itself is new and very clean with wonderful decor, high ceilings, a sushi bar and regular bar with one television. Exceptional service. The food is fantastic and fresh. So delicious. We started with the Grilled Hamachi Collar: bone in hamachi collar grilled to perfection and served with Ponzu sauce. For our meal we had the Florida roll: salmon, tuna, cream cheese, avocado, masago and sesame seeds. Dancing dragon roll: spicy ahi tuna, tempura shrimp and cucumber, topped with tuna, sweet eel sauce, spicy Mayo, sesame seeds, masago and scallions and the Zukku roll: tempura shrimp, cucumber, crab mix, salmon, lemon slices, masago, scallion, spicy mayo, sweet eel sauce. They were all wonderful, my favorite was the Zukku roll. Beautiful presentation. For dessert the server would not let us leave without trying the carrot cake fried ice cream, and we are so glad she did. Vanilla shortbread ice cream surrounded by carrot cake flash tempura  fried. Absolutely one of the most delicious non chocolate desserts I've ever had. Not too sweet, just perfect. Will definitely be back!!!",2,"good"
