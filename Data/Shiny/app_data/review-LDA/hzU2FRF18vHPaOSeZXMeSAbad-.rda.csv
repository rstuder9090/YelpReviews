"2","I happened to be in the area for a client and met up with my brother after work.  He talks about Miyabi's all the time (he works close by).  So finally I had the chance to see the hype.

We ordered and shared the Godzilla roll (Salmon, tuna and white fish roll deep fried with chef 's special spicy sauce and caviar), Incredible roll (Shrimp tempura avocado inside topped with spicy crabmeat and special sauce), Infinity roll (Crunchy spicy tuna topped with smoked eel, avocado, caviar and sweet sauce, and the Amazing roll (Spicy crab and avocado inside topped with crunchy spicy tuna and bonito flake).  All of these specialty rolls were priced at $6.95 and a really good value for the quality.

I wasn't really a fan of the deep fried roll, but only because I don't normally like too much tempura batter.  My favorite was the Amazing roll, the bonito flakes really added to the flavor.  

I had no issues with service.  I had my hot tea refilled quickly.  If I was closer in the area, I'd probably stop by more often.",1,"good"
"3","My family orders takeout from here on a decently regular basis and have also celebrated a few birthdays in the restaurant. We've never had a bad experience or had them forget anything in the take out orders.

I always order one of the sushi combos and I love that it comes with miso soup and their salad with the ginger dressing. Lately I've been getting the salmon lover combo which I will be including a picture of with my review. It's delicious and makes this salmon addict a happy camper. The spider roll is also good and consists of tempura fried soft shell crab. 

The tempura ice cream is amazing though, My parents, sister, brother in law, nieces, boyfriend and I all had some after our meals and were in love.",2,"good"
"4","Worst customer service EVER!!! After about 10yrs of going I can say we will not be back!!! Ordered some Pad Thai HORRIBLE, and the waitress actually said ""well we Japanese restaurant not Thai"". Well if you can't cook it right don't cook it at all. We asked can we swap it for something else worth the same amount ""NO we don't do that"". So $9.99 is worth loosing over 10yrs of loyal service. Charges will be disputed and they won't get payed anyways. And this is step 1 of many. EPIC FAIL",1,"bad"
"5","So I called in for a take out  this past Friday. Upon entering I was greeted with the woman getting defensive & explaining why her items -seemed skimpy. It was quite Abrupt, as I was taken back. I didn't know why she was getting defensive Until I realized it was my review, of saying the soup & salad  seemed small. 
After leaving the restaurant , I realized that was Not a way to have a return paying customer. I have tried 2x to give them benefit of the doubt, but They have failed as far as Customer Service. I worked in Customer Service for 15+ years, You don't respond to a review -by getting defensive . My review wasn't even negative.4-stars.
I have had reviews with other places, & business owners sent message advising to please come back, we will try to improve , or her approach should have been Less defensive , * soo many others ways to go about it without offending customers.
** Well on that~ I will Not be returning. 

Be careful, If You voice your opinion here, may get back lash when you decide to go back.",2,"bad"
