"2","I Live directly across the street from Izumi and, because I had to suffer through the early morning construction for what seemed to be an eternity, I expected to hate it.  It's true, what can I say, 8 am buzzsaws make me very cantankerous.  I was even more concerned when I read about their plans to put tables around the fountain in the intersection in the warm weather months, as P'unk ave drinkers sometimes tend to forget that people do, in fact, live here and can be a little over boisterous at 2am.  In light of all that, I agreed to try the place out very reluctantly.  I'm really glad I did.

My boyfriend, one of my friends and I decided to give Izumi a whirl on a warm Friday night about a month ago or so.  They had not yet gotten clearance from the neighborhood association to expand their outside seating to the fountain and the place was packed.  The server who met us at the door cheerfully informed us that there would be an hour wait for seating and that they are a BYOB, but that Paradiso has take out if we wanted to grab a six pack to bring back with us.  She also listed all of the bars along the Ave that would be good places to hang out while we waited and offered to call our cell phones when our table was ready.  Needless to say, Izumi had me at ""Hello"".   Where else can you get such VIP service without actually having to throw money around like you're a high roller?

We returned home to have a beer and wait for the call, which came pretty quickly with an offer to sit at the counter if we wanted, or to wait the full hour for a table.  We elected to sit at the counter and within mere minutes, we were happily seated with full wine glasses and were enjoying the show of sushi chefs adeptly carving through jewel like pieces of fish.  

Now, I have to admit here that I am not the most adventurous  of sushi eaters and I typically stick to California rolls and veggie rolls.  However, the boyfriend was very excited that they had sea urchin on the menu and he went to town ordering a ton of ala cart sashimi and a few pieces of sushi.  I stuck to my old standby of California roll and tried Izumi's Passyunk Ave Roll, which is shrimp tempura with some kind of spicy crab salad.  What truly impressed me was this, the California roll was less expensive than any of the take out and fast service sushi places throughout the city and it contained REAL CRAB.  With a C, and not a K!   An hour later we were all happily stuffed to the gills and ready for a nap.  I will return to Izumi for sure.  And, now that they do have those fountain side tables set up, I have been happily reassured that they are not creating a neighborhood nuisance, but a charmingly local place that seems to bring a lot of relaxed smiles to the Ave!",1,"good"
"3","100th review, baby!

I gave a lot of thought to what i wanted to review for my 100th, and I decided to pick a place that would be a treat, and one that I had been meaning to try for a while. I eventually decided Izumi was all of those things, plus sushi is E's favourite and I've been craving it lately. When I called first they were on vacation for a week, so i waited patiently for them to reopen and booked a table for the next night.

We considered asking for an omakase but I decided I wasn't hungry enough for it. We each selected a few rolls, a few types of sushi, and miso soup plus a special crab spring roll to start. The spring roll was delicious, packed with tons of crab and perfectly seasoned. I almost wished it had a little more wrapper- there was one thin layer holding it all together and I wished for a bit more of a crunch on the outside, but I'm gluten-intolerant and shouldn't have eaten it anyways, so my tummy was glad there wasn't much wrapper. The miso soup was overly salty to the point I couldn't eat it, and I love salty so that says something. Minus one point for screwing this up and charging $5 for it.

I couldn't have been more pleased with my selections. The yellowtail scallion roll, always my favourite, was perfect. The salmon roll, however, was even better! The salmon was melt-in-your mouth and tasted so fresh, plus there was a lot of it. No rice-heavy rolls here. I also indulged in a few pieces of E's Tuna on Top roll, shrimp tempura inside with spicy tune and crunchies on top. I'm not usually huge on spicy sushi, the mayo/mushy aspect of it usually grosses me out, but this was delicious. I also got an order of yellowtail sushi after being told that the fatty tuna was only available on the weekends. The fish was phenomenal, and I thought it was perfectly portioned to be one bite, but there was wasabi hiding under the fish and I hate wasabi. Ruined it a bit for me, but once I was already halfway through chewing.

E also got a rainbow roll and two orders of sushi and ate every bit. We were stuffed to the brim by the end of this feast! The bill was $74 including tax, which isn't half bad for such good quality sushi. Service was attentive (although I had to ask for water refills) and decor was very nice. It did get a bit loud, since the space is pretty tiny. We'll be back, but I think I like Zama just a bit better.",2,"good"
"4","Overpriced.  Miso Soup - $5.  Green Tea - $5 Single small piece of nigiri - $3-3.50.  Standard small rolls - $6 or more.  Fancy Special (but still not very big) roll - $12 or more.

I am surprised more people here are not outraged by the prices.  I'm accustomed to spending about $20 on a couple rolls, edamame/miso and feeling full and satisfied.  When I ordered $30 of food and still didn't think it would be enough, I commented that this would probably be some fantastic fish.  The Miso was tasty, but the $5 price has to be a scam.  My 2 pieces of nigiri were about the smallest cuts of fish I've ever had.  They tasted great, but nothing special.  The Izumi roll was also great, but small and $12.

The vegetable rolls are very small, but more reasonably priced ($4).  My boyfriend ate for much cheaper than I did.

My guess is that this place is great for bringing a bottle of wine and spending a lot of money on the entrees and more experimental dishes/specials.  (There are a LOT of specials)  I assume that they hike the prices because there are no other sushi options within walking distance.  It seems to me though that more reasonable prices on standard sushi fare (nigiri, sashimi, rolls) would influence more people like me (with a smaller budget) to use their weekly sushi allotment there.  On a lovely Tuesday night at 7, there were several tables open inside and outside.  The food was just fine, but I've eaten similar quality for cheaper.  If the prices were more reasonable I would say 4 stars.",1,"bad"
"5","Last night, the Boy and I ventured down to the Philly Night Market in South Philly and like so many others, once we saw how long the lines were, we decided to find a restaurant to eat at instead, and just enjoy the ambiance. 

We've heard quite a bit about Izumi, and we're always on the lookout for GOOD sushi (not that many choices in this city), and since they were able to seat us right away at the bar, this seemed just perfect!

Flash forward 2 hours and 40 minutes later, we'd consumed roughly 6oz of food apiece. The kitchen had botched our order 3 times; the only way we managed to get any food whatsoever was when our concerned waitress wandered over every 40+ minutes to cock her head to one side and muse ""oh, did you not get your such-and-such yet? I'll go check!"" Only to put the order back in the kitchen's queue, not at the front of the line, where it should have gone. 

I take full blame for not standing up for myself and pointing out how ridiculous their multiple errors were. I'm not complainer by nature, but this was beyond any mistake I've seen in a restaurant. At the end of our stay, when the waitress sheepishly informed us that our last dish was ""still cooking....slowly. Do you want to just get your check?"" I told her to just forget it. We then saw them pull a raw piece of meat out of the oven and throw it away. We would have been there for another 45 minutes, at least. 

What infuriated us the most was the lack of offering to take something off the check, let alone comp the whole dinner. Or at least bring over something as a ""while you're waiting"" apology. I don't feel as though the world owes something to me, but I do believe in restaurant etiquette. The restaurant was crowded, but there wasn't a line out the door - it was just ""normal full"". As the tables around us were efficiently fed and turned over, I resigned myself to leaving a 0% tip (NEVER did that before!) and promised to  never darken their doorway again.

I give this place one star for 2 reasons: 1.) Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars 2.) The food that they did give us (a hastily ordered salmon-and-avocado roll and a spicy tuna roll - not exactly what you go to a destination sushi place to eat - just to have something to chew on!) was actually pretty good. Thanks for a lot of nothing, Izumi. Maybe I'll come back the next time I have a 3+ hour car inspection waiting time.",2,"bad"
