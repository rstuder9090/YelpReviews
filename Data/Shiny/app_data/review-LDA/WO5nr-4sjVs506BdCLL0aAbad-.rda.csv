"2","KUCHI Sushi & Hibachi is a fairly new combination restaurant that serves fresh sushi and sashimi on one side of the restaurant, and sit-down Japanese Hibachi-style cooking on the other side of the restaurant. Normally these types of hybrid restaurants do a good job in one area, but fail in the other, however KUCHI has found the successful formula to blend fresh and innovative sushi rolls with the artistic showmanship and delicious cooking on the hibachi grills.

You'll find KUCHI in the AMC 24 Veterans movie theater shopping center along Anderson Road. There are several other restaurants, coffee shops, and bars on the various outparcels around the movie theater. Unfortunately many of the previous restaurants have gone out of business after a short while, leaving me to wonder if this shopping center is haunted by the ghosts of restaurants past?

KUCHI has been open about three months as of this writing, and the exterior still looks a lot like the former Bennigan's restaurant that occupied the same space. Through the front doors and you'll be greeted by the hostess who asks if you want to have sushi or hibachi-style dining. If you say ""hibachi"" then you'll be led to the left to the traditional U-shaped tables around the hibachi grill. If you say ""sushi"" you'll be directed straight ahead to either sit around the large sushi bar, or at one of the nearby tables. I have no idea what they will do if you say ""both"".

On the sushi side of the restaurant, they also have a small sake-tasting bar in the back of the room. Presumably this is where you would sit and wait for the rest of your party to arrive before being shown to your hibachi table.

On this particular night I decided to sit at the sushi bar and try some of their rolls, although on my next visit I'd like to try the teppanyaki menu choices. The bulk of the menu is filled with creative sushi rolls and sushi special combinations, KUCHI offers traditional nigiri and sashimi, but the focus seems to be on their rolls. If raw fish isn't your thing then the flip side of the menu has teriyaki, tempura, katsu and noodle dishes, in addition to the plethora of protein choices that can be grilled up on the hibachi by your chef. They have some limited vegetarian options, but this is primary steak, chicken, and seafood on the grill.

For my dinner I ordered the Spicy Maki combo which were three rolls - spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy yellowtail. Very basic, and very good. Upon the recommendation of my server I also ordered the Painted Lady roll which was a spectacular combination of spicy lobster with mango and asparagus, topped with spicy tuna, and avocado, and served with mango sauce and Sriracha. That roll was delicious!

The emphasis is on the chef's knife skills and artistic presentations of each plate of sushi. I watched them carving little statues made with daikon radish and carrot which were true works of art. It would be fun to go back with a group and watch them prepare larger platters and sushi boats with these playful creations.

I do hope that KUCHI beats the odds and stays open for a while. I'd like to go back and try some more of their sushi, and possibly get a group together to go for their hibachi-style meals.",1,"good"
"3","Fantastic meal at Kuchi!! As big hibachi fans, we were all sad when our favorite local restaurant closed recently, and have been looking for a new spot. We decided to try Kuchi on a whim, as it is right next to our favorite movie theatre. Let me just say, we were BLOWN AWAY!

The service was fantastic. The server was very attentive and friendly, the manager and owner each visited our take making sure everything was living up to our expectations, and even the bus boy was incredibly courteous. The chef was probably the best Hibachi chef we've ever had. Funny, friendly, and despite a little bit of a language barrier (he told us he came over from Korea within the last month), he worked very hard to make sure we were happy. An offhand observation that they used real garlic instead of garlic butter led to extra garlic on everything for us (after asking to make sure it was okay, of course). We all got saki squirted into our mouths, every trick you've seen and a few you haven't was performed, and we could not stop laughing the entire time.

The food was fantastic. Nothing was anything less than you've had anywhere else, and the steak in particular (our party had both the filet and standard sirloin) stood out from any other hibachi restaurant. The meal was finished with a nice bowl of ice cream, completely unexpected. 

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the effort that went into decorating. The restaurant is clean, modern, distinctly Japanese but not overdone to the point of being kitschy. The best word we came up with to describe it was sleek. Clearly, every detail of the restaurant and your meal was thought out, and it's clear management really cares about your experience. I can't recommend Kuchi highly enough, and we're thrilled to have found a new favorite hibachi restaurant!!",2,"good"
"4","Unfortunately we had a poor experience from beginning to end.  We went to Arigato's often in Carrollwood before it closed and frequent Kobe's as well.  We have an 8 year old daughter who loves the whole experience.  So I googled to see if there was a different Japanese Steakhouse we have not taken her to yet.  Kuchi popped up and has some pretty good reviews.

We arrived about 5:45 to avoid the Friday crowd.  At this time, there were only two tables taken and the rest of the restaurant was empty.  The hostess immediately brought us in and sat us directly next to the beverage and service area.  The worst table in the place.  Then she proceeded to sit us as the end of the table with no one else waiting.  I asked if we could move to the center and was immediately told no in case others showed up.  

We were promptly served water and then ignored for about 20 minutes.  This is when I decided to call over the waitress and order a couple rolls of sushi because I figured they were going to make us sit until the table filled.  About 15 minutes later while the sushi was being rolled the waitress asked when the rest of our party was going to arrive???  I told her that we were the only ones in our party and that we were ready to order.  It is now 6:30.

Within 2 or 3 minutes our sushi arrived.  We took about 2 bites and they stacked our soup and salad in front of us at the same time.  At 6:38 the fried rice was already on our plates and the meat was cooking.  Mind you that we have not even started our salads.  This is when I called over the manager.  He kinda gave a small apology and said he would check his computer and see what he could do???

I told him that I was unhappy with the entire experience and that our hibachi chef was doing nothing except throwing food on our plates as quickly as possible. Not quite why we brought our daughter to this style restaurant.  By 6:42 our complete meal was on our plates.  Yes it was about 12 minutes from start to finish for the chef to make fried rice, noodles, fillet, shrimp, and lobster for 3.  He cleans and leaves within 2 minutes.  Since our hot food was getting cold, we handed the waitress our sushi, salad and soups so we could start our meal.

The manager came back by we told him again how dissatisfied we were with everything and pointed to the fantastic chef at the other table who had kept his table entertained and served at a proper rate for about 45 minutes our more.  He said yes he is really good and then proceeded to tell us how he normally doesn't talk about this but our chef's last day is going to be on Tuesday.  So, I asked him why he thinks it is fair to us to give us the worst table in the joint, have us sit for nearly 45 minutes unattended, and then give us a sub par chef.  He really didn't have much to say and didn't seem to care too much.  

Finally we begin eating our meal and actually the food was pretty good.  Unfortunately our glasses were empty for most of the meal and we ran out of the little bit of sauce for our meals about half way through.  Our waitress decided not to come by the entire time we were eating the meal.  About 10 minutes after we finished eating she finally came back by.  Our glasses do not even have an ice cube in them at this point.  She never once asks if we would like a refill.  She brings the bill with a 30% discount.  I walked over and thanked the manager for the discount and informed him to look over at our drinks and lack of sauce and told him that we were never offered a refill the entire night.   Got a nod with an possible slight look of concern.  Then I walked over to the sushi chef and tipped him because he was the only person in the restaurant that we dealt who seemed to care about what he was doing.

This was an unacceptable experience if the restaurant was completely overwhelmed, but  there were only 3 tables for most of our time there.  Many were showing up around 7.  Hopefully they gave them the A team...for some reason we got the soon to be ex-employees.  Funny...what I never heard from the manager...this type of thing rarely happens...please give us a try again...let me take care of your meal and truly want to apologize...here is a gift card for a free appetizer next time you come in...here is my card-ask for me next time and I'll make sure your experience is better...NOTHING!!!  He could have potentially saved a customer, but he didn't.  I spent $70 instead of $100 for a miserable Friday night dinner with the family.  I don't care about the money.  However, I do not think a restaurant should charge anything when they completely drop the ball from start to finish.  From the manager to the attitude of the staff, they obviously do not care enough.",1,"bad"
"5","Not so great experience here.  Should've left when we realized the table at which we were seated was covered with ants. Moved to the teppanyaki tables instead.  

Ordered one roll of sushi to try while we waited for our hibachi dinners...it wasn't even edible.  The tuna on top of the roll was pink and gray-green and smelled horrible.  We told the waitress that we didn't want it, she told another woman that works there that we were sending it back. That woman asked if we'd like to get a different roll (um, no thanks...).

The teppanyaki was just ok.  I've had much, much better at other restaurants.  

The atmosphere was cheesy.  The decor might've been pretty but it didn't match the super casual behavior of the chefs.  The shows they put on are fun to watch but when they start throwing food into the patrons' mouths (and just generally AT them), it's tough to sell ""classy"".  Sure, I laughed, it was a little funny but when they started squirting saki from giant mustard bottles into our table mates' mouths (and hounding us to let them do the same to us), I was pretty much done.  

On our way out, no one bid us goodbye, said thank you - nothing - because the woman at the door was too busy texting.

Waste of a date night dinner :(",2,"bad"
