"2","It has been quite a while since I've been to Tsunami. The atmosphere is exactly the same. It's still nice and comfortable. I can't remember why I stopped going, but I think it had something to do with slow service. The service was way better this time around. Len was super helpful and patient. He helped with seating mom comfortably in her chair, and boxed up her food at the end of the meal. It's the extra things that make us happy.

The menu must have changed somewhere in between 2006 and today. The specialty sushi roll menu in particular didn't jump out at me this time because a lot of the items contain cream cheese. I get it. Many people like the mixture of ingredients with cream cheese. I'm not one of them. I'm sure they would have excluded it if I asked, but felt I should point that out. The mussels appetizer is no longer TNT style. They are made in the chef's special Kunjun style. It was very good, and the mussels were large. I prefer the wasabi/Japanese mayo version over this one. With that said, it was still a welcomed change flavor-wise.

I've always liked their hibachi dishes. That's what we ordered. She got the shrimp and I got the shrimp & steak combo. It comes with a very generous portion of salad with ginger dressing. I love their ginger dressing! It's not that bright orange (almost artificial) dressing that I've had at other restaurants. I ate almost all of it. I could eat salad all day with this type of dressing. You also get a choice of miso or clear soup. The clear soup was average, but tasty. The dinner portions are a very good size. Everything was cooked very well. The fried rice had this very good smoky flavor from the wok. I think I detected a hint of oyster/fish sauce along with that great smoky taste. The shrimp and steak were of good quality. The yum yum sauce was on point. It was all very good. Definitely enough for 2 meals. We had leftovers. Oh, and the Moscato wine was very good as well as the hot green tea. They had other wine options as well. I think I'll try the German Riesling next time. I won't wait another 10 years to return.",1,"good"
"3","So many great things to say about this place! I left here super satisfied and can't wait to come back in the near future. I only wish this establishment was located closer to my home. 

The service: 
Our waitress was very kind and attentive. She fulfilled all our requests very quickly. Our food came out super quickly and super fresh. I don't know what happens in the kitchen but they are well prepared and didn't keep us waiting. 

The food:
I can't say enough great things about the food. Every single food item I received was delicious. I've been to a lot of sushi hibachi restaurants in the past but this is by far one of the best. I was provided with a large amount of salad and miso soup. The miso soup was delicious and full of flavor. Some places I've been the soup can taste quite watered down but not here. The sushi rolls were down right delicious. I've never had a peanut avocado roll but decided to give it a try and wasn't disappointed in the least. There is a huge selection of sushi rolls available. I am vegan and the others I was with are not. There was something for everyone and each person in my party enjoyed their meal. I am also very nervous about getting tofu in my hibachi. I just feel sometimes the tofu is spongy or not well prepared. However, I took a risk and got the tofu here and I am so happy I did! It was absolutely delectable! I just can't say enough wonderful things about this establishment!! The food was by far some of the best I've had.

The atmosphere:
The restaurant was clean and orderly. It was a nice relaxing atmosphere and overall pretty quiet. It's a nice setting for a family or even a medium sized party. We had 5 people in our party and were very comfortable. The parking lot was quite busy and it was a little hard finding parking on a Saturday evening. There are many other restaurants nearby so the area tends to be busy on the weekends. 

Overall:
This is a great establishment! The food, service and atmosphere are wonderful. If you are looking for a great sushi hibachi place look no further. This place has vegan options and they are very accommodating. This place is truly a gem!!",2,"good"
