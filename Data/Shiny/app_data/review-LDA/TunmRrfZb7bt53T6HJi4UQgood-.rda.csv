"2","Let me first start with the fact that when we choose to try a new sushi spot, we do not mess around.  The only thing that I am probably more serious about is soup.  This is why we were extremely pleasantly surprised to find Bleu Sushi nestled away in Center City.  They had no problem accommodating our larger party (7 people to be exact) for our 11-year-old daughter's birthday dinner, Even our family that was visiting from Florida was impressed and asked that we return next time they come to visit.

We started with the scallops and shiitakes, salmon oshinko, and a salmon skin salad (I have a slight obsession with salmon skin).  The scallops were cooked perfectly and dredged in a beautiful savory sauce, but the mushrooms were even better.  The consistency is what made them so amazing, not too firm and not too soft, and piping hot.  They were easily my favorite thing we had all night, and if i could simply get pounds of these mushrooms cooked this way, I would come here every single day, just for them.  The salmon oshinko was actually very interesting, not something we had tried anywhere before, but was recommended by our server, so we thought we'd try it.  It had a very nice smoky salmon flavor, almost like nova lox, and went really well with the other vegetables that were wrapped up with it.  Then there was the salmon skin...  not anything spectacular or different, but it was a ton of salmon skin, which is exactly what I wanted, and it was presented in a nice semi-sweet glaze which made it hard to not eat all of it before anyone else had any.

Out of the seven of us ,only my youngest daughter does not eat sushi, so she had chicken teriyaki, while the rest of us ordered a large sushi boat, which blew the birthday girl away.  Her teriyaki was perfect and was nice and tender with a good amount of sauce, with really nice sticky rice and seared veggies on the side.  The boat was huge and a ton of care was put into the presentation, complete with some glowing cubes that really caught her attention.  I don't remember every roll that we ordered for the boat, but the ones that really jumped out at me were the Temple, Villanova, Ten street, and Drexel rolls.  There were a couple more, but I don't remember what they were.  They were all fantastic, super fresh, and different.  Each one was unique in its own way, with the Temple and Villanova being similar, but it was the Villanova that really blew me away.  It seemed to be a nicely-sized spicy tuna roll, but is topped with salmon that is garnished with fresh cracked black pepper and then seared with a torch till it has wonderful crispy brown edges.  Not only did it have a great smoky, crispy flavor and texture, but it filled the restaurant with this amazing scent of grilled fish; something neither I or Jen had seen done anywhere before.  Honestly, it is worth visiting Bleu Sushi simply for this roll, or maybe two or three orders of this roll.  Pair this with those mushrooms from the scallop dish, and I would be in heaven.

We were barely able to finish all the food we had ordered but the staff came out of left field and had a small cake for our older daughter and gave everyone else at the table assorted ice cream dishes as part of the birthday celebration.  This was really nice and really made her night.  Everything here was great and we will definitely be returning here in the future.  If you are around the Jefferson hospital area and want a great Japanese meal, check out Bleu Sushi, you will definitely not be disappointed!",1,"good"
"3","Creative, amazingly delicious and fresh sushi.  Have gone here for years -- mostly taking advantage of their great lunch specials but now and then for a lovely setting for dinners.  Now in Covid take-out mode, I placed pretty large order easily on-line and it was ready very quickly.  They called to let me know and to see if I had any questions about pick up.  They use an intriguing robotic arm -- lit up in blue neon -- which passes your order to you out their front windows.  It's a gimmick, I'll grant you, because a human touched the bags to pack them and put them onto the arm in the first place so not really contactless except you are standing further apart.  It's fun to watch; seems a pricy solution but glad they are making the effort.  Caveat: Manager should wear mask properly -- it was dangling well below the nose and he was talking over the top of it, defeating the whole purpose of the mask. That could cause people some discomfort in feeling their order and food have not had covid virus breathed onto it while packing up. (He sets the standard for the rest of the staff, afterall. If they are semi-masked up front, what's going on in the kitchen?)  Still, if they can pull up their socks (er, masks) on that issue, this is a great take out option.  (Wish I could post photos, but we ate everything too quickly!)  Spent $92 for 3 people including tip and felt it was pricey but worth it; depending how and what you order, you could spend much less.",2,"good"
