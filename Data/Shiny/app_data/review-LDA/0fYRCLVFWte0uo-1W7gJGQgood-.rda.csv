The spicy tuna crispy rice and truffle salmon roll are some of the best I've had in Nashville. Also, the seaweed salad is gluten free which is a rare find! They are very accommodating with altering my rolls to ensure they are gluten free. Sushi on broadway was an unexpected find, but I definitely recommend trying this place- so yummy!",1,"good"
"3","Wasn't sure how the sushi would be with such a small set up that they have for the sushi counter in the Assembly Food Hall but they absolutely delivered. I ordered the Hurricane Shrimp Roll and subbed Crab for the Spicy Tuna and it was delicious. Super fresh and the Spicy Mayo is on point (has a good kick, but not super hot). Will absolutely be back.",2,"good"
