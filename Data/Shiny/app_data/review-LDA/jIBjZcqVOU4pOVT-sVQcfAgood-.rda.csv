"2","My husband and I are sushi junkies. We absolutely love it and could eat it multiple times a week without batting an eye. Where we live, we get some pretty good sushi, but it's nothing like the sushi we had when we ate at IRB Sushi. Holy smokes it was delicious! Often here in Cincinnati, we often treat ourselves to sushi when the few places around here offer half-priced sushi deals on certain nights of the week. For the price and quantity we had here, it blows every single place we go to locally, right out of the water. The fish was delicious and fresh, the rolls were beautifully crafted, it was truly an enjoyable meal and we both enjoyed every single bite we had. For the two of us to have 5 rolls, and two house salads, the damage was a mere $53. We looked at the bill and our jaws just dropped. That's such an inexpensive tab for the meal that we had. The server we had was great, she was attentive, and kept our drinks filled, despite being completely busy. My only concern was the amount of open space in the actual restaurant felt a little... empty. Like they could have fit at least 3 or 4 more 4-top tables in. That would have eliminated the need to wait for 30 minutes like we had to when we first arrived. 

This was our first trip to IRB, but I know when we come back, we're going to be going to IRB Sushi again!",1,"good"

I've been coming out 1-2x a month the past 7 mos, and most of my concerns below have been resolved. The chefs are now the same chefs every time, and their cuts prove that they are honing their craft. And they are friendly. I have not had warm rice or a warm plate any more. The servers are more knowledgeable, and settling in and more friendly.  (ask for Cheryl) 
The manager is around every time I am there, interacting with the tables, genuinely taking pride in the establishment. 
Most importantly, the fish is still very very fresh, without exception every time I am here, the fish itself is high quality.  I have tried a handful of other similarly priced/styled sushi places locally, and they just aren't getting the quality of fish that IRB Sushi is getting.  
You can opt out of cream cheese in a roll, no problem, just ask.
When you ask for light sauce, I do think they are some of the best rolls I have had.

Sushi happy hour is quite a bargain if you can make it between 4-6p tues-thur.

They still have these mystery secret rolls available not on the menu, you have to ask or read the signs in the place. Tom Tom and Tsunami are good.",2,"good"
