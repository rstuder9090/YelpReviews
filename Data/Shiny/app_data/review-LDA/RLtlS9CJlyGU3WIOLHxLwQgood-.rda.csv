"2","Oishii is a new ramen and sushi place located at the Old City neighborhood. They have a good variety of sushi and ramen to choose. I ordered 2 times already and so far we've tried the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, Chicken Miso Ramen, Green Curry Ramen, Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, Volcano Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Tokyo Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll. 

The tonkotsu ramen has a good flavor, i'd say even better than most tonkotsu ramen i've ever tried in South Philly area so far. The soup is also not too thick, which I like very much, because I found some Tonkotsu ramen has a very thick soup since it is made out of pork broth and it could make you nauseous sometimes if you eat too much. My dad got the chicken miso and he loves it. He says it has a perfect balance of flavors. The Green Curry ramen as well as the Tonkotsu Ramen have a good spicy flavor. If you like spicy food, you'd want to try either one of them. Although, the Green Curry is more spicy than the Spicy Tonkotsu according to my husband who had it. 

Their Las Vegas Roll is to die for!! I personally doesn't like spicy food so I request the Las Vegas Roll without Jalapeno, which they very kindly and gladly made it for me, and it was awesome!! Their sushi overall is pretty good. They know how to make a good sushi! 

I don't have all the pictures of the food we've tried but what I have I posted it here. I'm so glad there's a good sushi and ramen place open up not too far from where I live. Oishii will be my go to place for sushi and ramen!!

PS: they're having a grand opening promo right now (i'm not sure for how long). You can get 20% off, which is a very good deal, if you order by phone/on their website and pick them up.",1,"good"
"3","I'm picky when it comes to both ramen and sushi, but doubly so places serving both. So many places either make one amazing and the other lackluster, or do mediocre jobs of both.

For once, a place that does both to a clearly very high standard! My roommate had ordered ramen the other day for a lunch, and it was so good that we decided we needed more plus sushi to test that out tonight. That way, if the sushi wasn't as good as the ramen, we had a backup. Happily, their sushi is amazing! Their portions are great sizes, and they paid attention to both an allergy note and a request for an ingredient to be left out just because it's a thing we don't like it. We got a bunch of add ins with the ramen too, so we can eat the leftovers over the weekend and mix/match it to our hearts content. It's cheap to start with, and even more so this way.

I'm hoping their menu expands further in the future too (I'd LOVE to see them do a Japanese curry with their katsu patty for example. I've yet to find a place in Philly that does that one the way places in Hawaii do.), but I have a feeling this is going to be a regular delivery option for us!",2,"good"
