When we arrived, we were expecting Hasu Japanese, which I had actually found on Yelp last week, but it turns out that placed opened and closed in the blink of an eye, and Makiman took over. 

No mind the brief confusion. As we entered the restaurant, we were immediatedly seated and the hostess assessed our bottles-in-tow and told us she would get us a bucket of ice and glasses for our sake, red wine, brandy... beer... ok, so we brought a LOT of booze with us, and the staff was nothing but smiles about it. I swear we must have cleaned out their entire cupboards of glassware, because all eleven of us must have had at least three different glasses to our person. 

Despite the fact that we had brought our own drinks, the staff provided us with unlimited, FREE caraffs of hot sake (complete with little ceramic cups), which they diligently refreshed everytime they visited our table (we were drinking like champs!). We were also graced with a free and DELICIOUS wonton cracker nacho-type appetizer with guacamole and raw tuna. These guys definitely have the 'fusion' thing going on... I didn't scrutinize the menu too deeply because our party opted for a ""Party Boat"" of sushi and sashimi (which came with salad and miso for all), but one of my friends ordered some sort of pork burrito appetizer that was also quite good. 

After all was said and done, our check for a group of 11 topped the scales at UNDER $100, including an 18% gratuity. So, folks, I think this place wins. And I encourage you all to pop in for a visit while they're still in their 'grand opening' phase and score yourself some freebies. I'll definitely be back.",1,"good"
"3","Back in March, we were trying to figure out where to go to avoid both the amateur hordes of St Patrick's day drunks, and the short attention span cheering of march madness. After some discussion, the answer struck us; Sushi!. Our party of five wisely made a reservation, as we arrived to find only two tables unoccupied on a busy Friday night. We had to wait a few minutes while the hostess quickly prepared one for us.

Makiman seems a bit of a tight space at first. There isn't much of a lobby or waiting area, and the front door pretty much puts you right into the center of the restaurant. There are two slightly separated dinning areas, each with about a half dozen tables, and another sushi bar area further back. Once we were seated, it didn't feel quite as small, and impressively the overall noise of the room didn't make conversation impossible. New guests arriving do end up waiting right in the middle of everything,

It's a BYO, and our server spotted my bottle of sake and asked if I wanted it heated, which I declined, instead asking for it to be chilled with our beer. As an aside, if you bring sake, check how it should be served, like wine different types of sake are served differently. She brought out the appropriate glassware and we started opening our bottles.

The soup and salad were pretty much par for the course, the usual miso soup and seaweed/microgreen salad you get at most sushi places. We also started with an appetiser of spicy rock shrimp tempura, which was fantastic, the sauce, tempura batter and shrimp were well balanced and didn't convey the greasiness of everyday tempura.

For entrees, most of the table chose a mix of rolls and pieces, but I went for the Chirashi. It came out with several generously sized pieces of several different sashimi, including tuna, salmon, shrimp, octopus, among others. It was well presented in an angled bowl atop a good amount of sushi rice, ginger and wasabi. Each type of sashimi tasted fresh, but I thought the salmon and tuna were the best of the group.

Another friend of mine chose one of the bi bim bop bowls, and that will certainly be something I go back for. They have several different options to choose between. The various rolls I saw around the table certainly looked tasty as well, and I managed to trade for one or two to confirm that.

We also chose to go with deserts, and both the banana tempura and ice cream proved a good choice to split. On a future visit, I'd definitely recommend the banana tempura. Also, we enjoyed the wooden boats being carried out filled with sushi, which would be a fine choice for another time.

The bill was reasonable, and being a BYO you can bring in ample sushi or other drinks to enjoy with your meal. Given the location, Reservations are probably a must over the weekend. They also do takeout and delivery it seems.",2,"good"
