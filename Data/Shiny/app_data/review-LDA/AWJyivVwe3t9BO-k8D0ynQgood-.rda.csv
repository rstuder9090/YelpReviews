"2","Cafe Square One is a hidden gem! I love to swing through on my lunch break for their enormous, affordable salads--full of protein and vibrantly colored veggies. They give plenty of dressing, too.

For breakfast, they offer huge bowls of oatmeal. Although I usually forego oatmeal while eating out (because I can make it at home), the sweet berries, mashed bananas throughout, and perfect texture makes Square One's oatmeal feel like a worthy takeout option. 

Pro-tip: Their rose latte is my favorite beverage--period. It's the kind of drink you sip slowly with your eyes closed.

The only reason I'm not giving this jawn five stars is the wait time: If you order at the counter, you've got a long wait ahead of you. Every. Single. Time. Even if you're planning to eat in the cafe, I recommend placing an online order ahead of time",1,"good"
"3","Oh God I love this place so much. Their wraps are absolutely massive and come with a side of loose tortilla chips, not the individual bags of chips that are available to purchase separately. They're also served up in a hard, clear plastic container instead of just wrapped up in paper.

I had the Chicken Club Wrap which did not stint at all on the chicken or avocado, two things that most places will try to go light on. It was amazing and incredibly filling, well worth $8.

For my second trip, a mere week later, I tried the Oriental Chicken Wrap which came again with lots of chicken and a good helping of almond flakes. The Asian sesame dressing paired well but did have the unfortunate side effect of dripping all over the place and making the 2nd half of my wrap a little soggier than I would've liked. Probably best to stick to creamier dressings in the future since the chipotle mayonnaise for the club wrap was no problem.

There's definitely an office-crowd lunch rush so try to get there before noon or after 1pm. It's a small operation and they're quick in processing the line of people for orders but, inevitably, slow down a little bit when it comes to rolling out the actual sandwiches/wraps.",2,"good"
