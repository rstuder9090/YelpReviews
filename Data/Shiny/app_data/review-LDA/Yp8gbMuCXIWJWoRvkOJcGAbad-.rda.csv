"2","I went here on a Friday night and I was surprised it wasn't packed.  We walked in and got a table right away (they also have plenty of seating at the sushi bar).  The server came to our table with warm towels for our hands, which I love.

Before ordering we asked our server a few questions about the menu and he was unable to answer them.  I don't know if he was new or the servers are just not knowledgeable about their menu.  He was nice though and turned to the chef behind the sushi bar and she was really helpful.  We started with the wasabi honey shrimp.  If you go here I suggest getting it!  The shrimp was delicious and the little crunchy balls of wasabi completed the dish.  We ordered the rainbow sushi roll, charlie brown sushi roll and the sushi box. All the fish was fresh and the rolls were perfectly made and tasty.  It was reasonably priced for sushi, with 2 glasses of wine we spent $70.  This has to be one of the better sushi places I have tried.

Overall, the place was clean, food was great and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I am giving this place a 4 though because the wait staff  could use some training.",1,"good"
"3","I had just taken a horrible sociological theory essay exam and my hand felt like it was going to fall off. I also felt like I had given birth, the test was that intense so I decided to try Wasabi Lakeview on my way home from school. 

I live in a condo on Lake Marina Drive so I can practically walk to the restaurant but I didn't. I drove. So sue me. 

My dinner was delicious. I started with the squid salad (perfect)  I had two of the rolls they had on special (from what I gather they are permanent specials) the Metairie roll and the Fuji Roll. I also had fresh salmon and eel sushi. The Sushi was so fresh and yummy. But the rolls were outstanding. 

The Metairie roll is tuna, snowcrab, avocado wrapped in white rice and drizzled with the eel sauce. But the Fuji Roll was out of this world. Inside the roll was tempura shrimp, cream cheese, snowcrab, wrapped in rice paper and then topped with shredded crab stick and crunchy. The roll was then topped with a delicious spicy mayo. 

The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out at lightening speed. (there was only one other table in there). I highly recommend this place. I've been to the one downtown several times and love it as well. I can't wait to eat at the Lakeview location again! (Sorry Hana).",2,"good"
"4","I have a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to sifting through my numerous Wasabi adventures. I used to come here all the time for their lunch and happy hour specials and the sushi has always been consistently good. There is a woman who works the sushi bar (I think she is the manager?) and she makes some BOMB sushi! She is possibly one of the best sushi chefs I've ever met. I actually used to get really excited when I came and saw she was working because I knew it would be a great experience. Joe, the bartender/owner is a super nice guy and he's great for a fun chat if you are feeling social and want to sit at the bar and make small talk. All in all...you would think I would have no issue with this place since I am clearly a repeating customer...HOWEVER...this place has a LOT of inconsistencies with their service. So many inconsistencies, in fact, that it makes it really hard for me to really endorse this restaurant in good faith. 

Ordinarily I would say the food quality at this place is 4 stars, but the service is consistently a definite 1-2 depending on the night. I haven't been to their other locations so I can't speak for them, but I might have just had one too many bad experiences here to come back in recent days. 

We came in on a Saturday evening with a group of 4. My group rallied and ranked many nearby restaurant possibilities before leaving a nearby bar and I was actually the one who encourage them to come and try Wasabi. I hadn't been back there in awhile, but I was nearly certain they would enjoy themselves and at least love the food even if the service happened to be slow (as usual). 

We sat down and it took them 10 minutes before acknowledging us (ok fair enough, seems like business as usual), and then another 10 minute for waters to arrive and then the server promptly left before we could give him our order, then another 10 minutes went by and he finally came to take our order, then 20 minutes went by just to produce 2 sushi rolls. We wanted to order more but our server NEVER came back to our table. He didn't refill our waters or ask us how we were doing or anything, he just dropped off the food and never came back. We finally just walked over to the sushi bar and told the sushi chef that we wanted more rolls, which his response was ""ok I get your server soon"" (the woman sushi chef that I previously mentioned was not working on this night). I kid you not, we were there for about an hour and half and all we could get out of this place were 2 rolls...and we were absolutely starving! Wasabi's service has always been pretty slow and unimpressive...but this was just ridiculous. 

We waited and waited to close out our tab but he never acknowledged us again. Finally, we physically chased him down in an effort to pay our tab so we could just leave. Having worked in service industry jobs in my younger days, I would never condone a ""dine and dash"" method, but we were literally running after them with our money and trying to force them to take it so we could leave in good conscience. Quite honestly, I think anyone else with less bother than I would have just gotten up and left.

In our server's defense, the dining room was packed and there was only ONE SERVER in the whole restaurant (which is actually typical for this location but I guess I hadn't been during a packed dinner before to see how bad it could really get). Our server looked like he was sweating profusely and about to have a nervous breakdown so I didn't take it personally. But I DID feel totally embarrassed that I had convinced my whole group to go there and then they all had this absolutely atrocious experience.

I don't want to totally discourage anyone from giving this place a try because for lunch or happy hour the service certainly seems much more tolerable, but avoid Wasabi at all cost if you have a group during peak dinner hours.",1,"bad"
"5","Went here with some coworkers and were awkwardly informed that we couldn't split the check beyond 3 checks. Also, when asked when lunch ends, the waiter couldn't even say a time, just that it had ended. 

The waiter made 6 people write down their orders on a blank piece of paper. When he would bring us a beverage or plate, he would only acknowledge one person at a time- take an order, process, return.  Never did he address the table as a group to ask if we had any more requests. 

At the end, I took it upon myself to split the check based on each persons order to determine how much we individually owed. After 10 min, the waiter impatiently said that he can now split it up into different checks. I had just finished and asked him to charge each card based on my calculations, even going so far as to writing down the last 4 digits of each card to be associated win each amount. He returned with individual receipts that were wrong. Each person was charged the wrong amount, and when added up, was different than the original total!

Terrible customer service!",2,"bad"
