"2","Needed to grab a quick and easy dinner one night while we were out and about in Central West End. Walking past Poke Doke, my boyfriend and I were both very interested! While we really were looking to dine-in, we decided the offerings at Poke Doke were well worth a grab and go situation. 

Ordering was really easy online. You picked your size and base. We both got soba noodles, but I ALMOST got the wonton chips. Next you select your poke and mix ins. I ordered Ahi and Spicy Tuna. Finally you picked your toppings and drizzles. They had so many awesome options. I chose avocado, edamame, crabmeat, masago and ginger. The drizzles all sounded so good, and I'm a sauce feind! I'm not even ashamed to say that I got my bowl topped with spicy mayo, teriyaki mayo, sweet thai chili, soy sauce and gochujang. There was a moment after I hit submit that I may have gone overboard on the sauces, but you only live once dear reader.

Shout out to the AMAZINGLY friendly employees of Poke Doke who made my meal so deliciously. Thanks for being awesome Ronnie, Ashley, Eric and John!! Y'all are fantastic for helping us get our grub during the pandemic. 

Picking up the food was very easy. There was a table just inside the entrance. You grabbed your bag and bolted. Easy as that! 

The bowls were so good. In my head I wanted to pretend like it was a light and healthy meal. But with all that mayo I added... I definitely had to run a few extra miles the next day. All of the toppings tasted extremely fresh. I highly suggest adding crabmeat. That was my favorite part and wish I would have added an extra scoop of it on my bowl. Can't wait to return to Poke Doke for another bowl.",1,"good"

That said, I don't know that the sashimi-grade fish used in Poke is going to vary a lot as I believe most of it is brought in frozen.  Salmon and tuna are pretty run-of-the-mill these days and the rest of the stuff offered is pre-cooked.  Besides, truly magnificent fish has no business being doused in sauce, co-mingled with a dozen ingredients and then squirted with even more sauce.

I had a small bowl for $10.  There were a lot of choices to be made and I started with the white sushi rice then selected the salmon & octopus for my proteins, added edamame (not listed as a protein but it is), sliced cucumbers, masago, wasabi, ginger, fake crab, fried onions, seaweed salad, a shot of eel sauce and a dash of sesame seeds to complete the dish.  I wouldn't say that it had the eye appeal of a well-made plate of nigiri or sashimi but you can't get either of those for ten bucks.

What should be fresh was fresh.  What should be crisp was crisp.  What should be...was.  Everything was competently made and the overall bowl was delicious.  While Poke is really not a substitute for sushi or sashimi in my book it is a good way to enjoy some of the same ingredients and you walk away full but not stuffed.

I've yet to reach the pinnacle of Poke available in the US but I do believe that PokeDoke puts out a very respectable product at a fair price and it is better than any of the other places I've tried thus far.",2,"good"
