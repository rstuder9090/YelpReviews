"2","I don't live anywhere near this neighborhood, but sometimes when I'm feelin' like a good jaunt and night drive around town is in order, I like to scope out new places. As the name tells you, call head and grab what you'd like to-go. The establishment itself is clean and no frills. Even with it being located near a busy, street-parking-is-hard-to-find intersection I was in and out in less than 2 minutes.

The prices are crazy delightful, the service is prompt and courteous and the food is pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken and shrimp teriyaki ($7.45), a specialty sushi roll ($8) and a side of kani salad (~$4). It wasn't the best teriyaki I've ever had, but it was hot, had good flavor with plenty of chicken and shrimp. The sushi roll was DELICIOUS and the kani salad was tasty as well.

This is a great spot for those nights when you might have that serious hibachi/sushi craving, but it's not quite payday. You'll be satisfied and fed in no time. Check 'em out!",1,"good"
"3","...and now, for a short play titled ""What Should We Have for Dinner?"":

Me: Sooooo... What should we have for dinner?
My husband: I dunno. Pizza?
Me: While my love affair with pizza runs deep, we had pizza yesterday.
My husband: Ummmmm... How about... PIZZA???
Me: (gives up, makes sandwich)

If you live in the area south of Snyder Ave., or what I like to refer to as ""the deep South"" of South Philly, you probably eat an ungodly amount of PIZZA. On just about every corner of every block of this neighborhood, you can stumble into one of many family-owned pizza and sandwich shops. Pizza joints are equally as prevalent in South Philly as our beloved corner bodegas and the word ""youse"". However, if you've already eaten pizza for dinner six times in one week and you are looking to add a bit of variety into your carb-loaded diet, give Hibachi 2 Go a buzz and order your weight in sushi for a fraction of the price of what other Philly sushi restaurants charge.

The first time my husband and I turned our backs on pizza and decided on a sushi feast from Hibachi 2 Go, we ordered four rolls and a salad for a little over $30. Some people may be skeptical of the combined words ""cheap"" and ""sushi"" and the words' ability to coexist without hinting toward possible gastric terror and a one-way ticket to botulism hell. However, we have ordered here five times since discovering this place, and with each order the sushi has been fresh and tasty, and we've lived to tell the tell and write a Yelp review about it. Hibachi 2 Go is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Now, if only they made sushi pizza... :)",2,"good"
"4","I will probably come back to revise this review at some point, because I'm hoping for an improved experience, but for now I have to be honest.  I went in to order some sushi to go and it was ungodly hot in this place.  It had to be 95 degrees or more in there.  I asked the woman at the counter if their air conditioner was broken.  She said they were installing it.  Meanwhile, the fish is sitting in 95 degree heat, not on ice from what I could see, and I was sitting in a very minimalistic 'dining space' melting.  Everyone there was very nice, and the sushi was impeccably made and packaged.  This unfortunately could not change the fact that it was warm, even borderline hot, and not because they were cooked rolls.  I ate them since I was ravenously hungry and had just shelled out $15.  They didn't taste bad, but one usually expects room temperature or cooler sushi, and it definitely impacted the flavor.

I am really hoping this was a fluke and I just happened to walk in on a really brutal day.  Even the warm, paranoia-inducing sushi was better than you would expect upon looking at the place.

I am also really hoping I don't wake up tomorrow with any form of food borne illness.

Seriously, guys, when it comes to perishable food, you really can't sacrifice temperature regulation.",1,"bad"
"5","I've been here for almost 2yrs & I think it's time I write this review.

When I first started coming here, food was GREAT.
Always tasty, looked appealing, great staff & affordable!
I've eaten plenty of things off the menu from their sushi to the teriyaki & even the salads.

THENNNNNN they changed owners, about summer time.

Once right after they switch, I ordered the chicken teriyaki.
Dude, was it even chicken? It was gray, completely flatten and had the same constancy as McDonald's nuggets, (GROSS!) My boyfriend & I did not even finish it. 

Anddd sadly TODAY I thought I give it one more shot. Man I was I disappointed.
Ordered spider roll & kani salad. It seriously look like a trainee made it. 
My roll was not completely cut through, this is even a first for me! I LOVE SUSHI!
How do you not cut the roll? Sushi is made to be BITE SIZE and to top it off everything fell apart!!!!!!! My sushi box was so messy, sauce everywhere- on the sides, napkins & plastic bag. And my kani salad I didn't bother to eat.

All in all this place used to be so good, and it's such a shame it turned to shits.
I do not recommend this place unless you want a friendly conversation with McDonald's style sushi.",2,"bad"
