I never go for sushi alone. I generally go once a week with a friend and we order 4 rolls and split everything and try something new always.  So I'm a huge sushi fan.  Generally going only for specialty rolls.

I was pleasantly surprised at Saki.  My waitress was great; she didn't rush me, and she let me know portion sizes and was able to answer all of my questions.  There weren't a lot of specialty rolls, but that is ok.  What Saki does is good, and you don't need 20 rolls from which to choose.

I will say that all of those people on Yelp who are saying this restaurant isn't friendly have clearly never dined in a true Asian run restaurant...or just don't get it.  VERY rarely does the staff gush over you...it's just not how Chinese and Japanese restaurants are run...you don't go there to get your butt kissed, you go there for delicious food that is very difficult to make at home.  That being said, I thought the staff here was extremely nice.

I asked my waitress Jodie about how the ""endless lunch"" truly worked.  She let me know that I could order as much as I wanted from the menu...and if there was any sushi left over, I would pay by the piece.  But I could order from ALL of the menu, not just sushi.  And if it was left over, I could take it with me.

One thing that is difficult when going for a sushi extravaganza lunch is that we only order sushi because it's so much food.  Here I was able to order other things as well and not be so stuffed that I was sick.

I started with the Miso soup- quite a full bowl- more than I expected and delicious taste.

I then ordered the Fuji roll and gyoza.  Even though the Fuji was 8 pieces, they weren't overly large, which is great.  (I often ask for ""light rice"" on my rolls)  There was a little too much spicy mayo (which I just wiped off), but the fish was fresh, and the rice was perfect.  The gyoza had only 3 pieces- which was perfect!  I almost didn't order because I thought it would be this huge 8 piece order.  Pleasant surprise as this is one of my favorites and  I rarely get them.

I actually was still a little hungry, but not enough for another roll.  I ordered the Kani salad- cucumber/crab.  I asked Jodie if it was too big, she assured me it was a nice, smaller portion.  A nice touch here is that you can order it with ponzu OR spicy mayo, instead of a heavy mayo laden one.  It was delicious- heavy on the crab, too.

All in all, with green tea, gyoza, miso soup, kani salad, and an 8 piece roll, my bill was only $14.00!!!  That is amazing, I spent over $30 last week for splitting 4 rolls in St. Pete.

My advice, go here with a friend and split some items.  Enjoy lots of different things.  And OVER-TIP your server!  Just because the food is cheap, doesn't mean these servers do any less work.  Just like a breakfast waitres...OVER-TIP! :-)",1,"good"
"3","Saki Endless Sushi & Hibachi Eatery is a great spot to fill up on ""All You Can Eat"" sushi, teriyaki, and hibachi-style meals for one low price. I didn't know what to expect, but a business associate assured me that the sushi was made fresh to order, and the $11 price tag for lunch is hard to beat.

Saki is located along US 19, right at the intersection of Gulf to Bay Boulevard (Route 60). This corner is known as the Clearwater Mall, and Saki can be found facing US 19, behind Michaels, and in between Lowe's and Costco. It's a bit tricky to find, but well worth the effort.

At lunchtime the restaurant fills up quickly, so plan to get there before the lunch rush. Once seated they hand you the menu and explain that you can order ANYTHING on the menu for the one flat price. Yes, anything.....and as much as you want. The only kicker is that if you leave food, or rice balls on your plate that you'll be charged a ""piggy fee"" and made to wash dishes for the rest of the afternoon.

So let's say that you check out the menu and decide to order a cup of Hot 'n Sour soup, or maybe some gyoza dumplings, and then a couple of pieces of traditional sushi, and maybe a maki roll or two -- and it's all one flat rate. Your dining companion might choose eggrolls, chicken wings, hibachi steak and some teriyaki shrimp -- and it's also one flat rate.

You can order sushi and sashimi either a la carte or on a platter, along with a surprisingly good variety of basic rolls and signature rolls. If you prefer the more traditional Americanized-Asian entrées you'll see sweet & sour pork, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, etc. From the hibachi grill they have steak, shrimp, chicken, salmon, veggies and more. Then finally they have teriyaki steak, chicken, shrimp, and salmon. That's right -- everything for one flat price, so mix 'n match to your heart's content.

I saw at least five different chefs behind the sushi counter slicing up the fish and making rolls as fast as their fingers could fly. I'm sure there were equal numbers of folks back in the kitchen preparing soups, salads, appetizers, entrées, and desserts. Plus there was a large staff of servers checking in on each table to see if you wanted to order more food, refilling drinks, and whisking away empty plates. It was all operating very fast and efficient.

The lunch price is $11, and the dinner price is $18 for all you can eat. There's also a $16 Endless Sunday price. According to the menu you can order individual rolls and entrée items priced per item. I can only conclude that these are to-go orders since everyone else seems to be oinking their way through the AYCE deal.

Heads up little porkers, if you like Asian food, and you're willing to strap on the feedbag and eat like there is no tomorrow, then you need to make a beeline to Saki Endless Sushi and Hibachi in Clearwater.",2,"good"
