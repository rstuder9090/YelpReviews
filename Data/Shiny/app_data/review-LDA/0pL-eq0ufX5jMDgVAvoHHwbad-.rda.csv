"2","Usually had good experiences here anyway..but it has been a couple of years since I've been there, and after seeing some of these reviews i wasnt sure what to expect this time. 

Well a friend and i ordered the Boat with the sushi & sashimi yesterday. It was EXCELLENT!  Very fresh. Good size portions. Great variety. There were at least 4 pieces of each sashimi item and they were nicely cut. And beautifully plated, of course. The white tuna (my fave) was to die for! 

Friendly, attentive service. Granted they were not busy at that time of day, but we sat at the sushi bar and had a lovely conversation with people working there...and they do not breathe down your neck or really push anything extra.

Can't wait to go back again!",1,"good"
"3","We tried other Japanese hibachi style restaurants before, but nothing came as close to being ""perfect"" than this one.  Mind you, we live in Huntingdon Valley, PA which is about 50 miles from this restaurant and we have been to this restaurant for 5 times already since they opened in late 11/2012.  We'd go more often if it is closer to our house.

Food is excellent and the staff is very courteous with services.  Gotta try the ""sushi on a ""flaming"" torch...  Wow!!  They bring the sushi on a plate (wrapped in aluminum foil) on fire, demonstrating a really impressive presentation.  Perfect for a couple on  a date.  'wink, wink' 

Ample parking space as well as really upscale decor thru-out.   If you want to go, go during the weekday evening for little more quiet ambiance as Saturdays are  little more noisier from the weekend crowd.   Reserve your weekend trip there for friends and family for more lively audience and crowd, if you are into those sort of events...",2,"good"
"4","Three adults and two toddlers went to Sakura in Sicklerville on January 1, 2021, to have the hibachi grill
experience.  We were hungry and excited so we arrived prior to the restaurant opening and we waited twenty minutes until it opened at 2 pm.  We were the first customers to arrive and the first customers to be seated at a hibachi table.  The table had ten chairs and we sat in the chairs facing the front of the grill.  The hostess advised us rudely that we needed to move to the side of the table just in case other customers arrive so she could fill up the table.  We moved over but we wondered why the restaurant would not be practicing ""social distancing"" because the chairs are very close.  We were served soup and salads and sodas.  About ten minutes after we arrived, ten customers were seated at a second hibachi table.  Only two hibachi tables had Customers in the entire restaurant.  Around 2:20 a hibachi chef started cooking at the table that arrived ten minutes after us.  At 2:30 pm our table still had no hibachi chef.  Our one and three year olds were hungry and getting inpatient.  We advised the hostess that we have been waiting for a hibachi chef for a half hour and we wanted to know what time someone would start cooking at out table.  We were shocked when we were told we had to wait until the chef was done cooking at the table that arrived after us and that likely the chef would not start cooking for us  until 3 pm.  This was very upsetting for us that we would need to wait an hour especially when we were the first and only customers at 2 pm when they opened.  We were not offered an apology nor an explanation except that the restaurant wants to fill the seats at the table.  This was a poor policy on a day when there were no other customers there for a hibachi table except for us and the second table.  Of course we left without service and still hungry.  Sakura in Sicklerville has poor customer service at the front door given by their rude hostess.  We will not return to this restaurant and we do not recommend going there.  They did not care that we had a hungry one and three year old.  This restaurant does not even deserve one star.  Very poor service!",1,"bad"
"5","I've been here many times. I always come for the Sushi. I'll start by saying that while a bit pricey, the Sushi is delicious and I've found Sushi generally works on the ""You get what you pay for"" scale. 

So why 2 stars?  I asked to put $60 on my card for my portion of the check, as the people I was there with were paying their portion with their own card. This simple request ended with me have 3 charges for $59.99, $63.23, and $60.00 on my card. I was told they messed up and voided 2 of the 3 charges. If you see my Tun Tavern review from years back, the same thing happened to me then! Do I have really bad luck on this or what?! 

You HAVE to be more careful with people's money! When I hand my card to a waiter/waitress to pay for food or services, I expect ONLY the amount billed to be charged. This hold is now a 5-7 day inconvenience where that money is unavailable. Luckily I don't need the money immediately, but this is $120 less that many people might not be able to have put on hold for upwards of a week. 

So go for the food and atmosphere - but I recommend standing over the register as they run your card or at the least mentioning that you expect them to not charge and void your card, AT ALL.",2,"bad"
