"2","I loved this place and would give it a five (one of my best restaurant outings ever) but there were some glaring pieces that reduce the overall quality of this place; I'll start with those to get them out of the way:
First (and perhaps most important) is that the chef messed up during his routine a couple of times; not in any huge way, but it was too noticeable.
Our waiter lied to us and told us one round of drinks was on him... it wasn't (but that's a long, complicated story... (my family dinners tend to get there))
No coffee or anything for after dinner besides ice cream. Also no egg rolls (I didn't mind but some of the people at my table did... I mean... It doesn't cater to that type of food specifically so... whatever).
Oh.... Speaking of people at my table (I'd probably call my family that... but no I'm not talking about them here), we had to sit with a random couple. It put me off since I didn't know about it but I guess I'll be prepared for it next time if I go again? (Probably not)
So... all of this complaining... how 4 stars?  Japanes malt liquor.
/The end...

....
I'm kidding, I'm still here.  Though each individual portion was a bit small (per course) it felt like I must have eaten 20 courses and I would have been well satisfied if I hadn't been so drunk off of Malt Liquor.... Also, is it ok to like a place because all of its staff is pretty or is that not PC?  Or maybe I should take another look at the staff minus the Malt Liquor.
Bathroom was top tier. 
The bar area was very cool and modern and I kind of found myself wishing I could have spent some more time in there.
Also, even though the waiter got us with the whole ""this round on me"" thing and proceeded to bring us all triple shots (basically) the price was still pretty reasonable.
Oh... all those courses by the way... delicious.  It's rare when I don't just shovel down food and actually savor the experience, and I don't even know what a savor is (some kind of Jedi sword maybe?) when I am as drunk as I was, but it absolutely cut through.
Also, lastly, I busted the chefs balls a bit because he messed a bit, but he really was an excellent showman and the things he didn't mess up on had me absolutely mesmerized... but again, Japanese malt liquor.  
Go there, but go early; it was perfect when we came but was quite literally packed when we were leaving.",1,"good"
"3","My only previous hibachi experience was at an all-inclusive restaurant in Mexico.  While they tried hard, it wasn't the hibachi experience I had always wanted to try.  So the hubster promised me a trip to Benihana - most of the hibachi places in the Lehigh Valley get lackluster reviews, so we figured we'd go to the trademark!

We chose to go for lunch, mostly to save cash.  Lunch hibachi meals range between 10-15 and include fried rice - dinner meals have more ""extras"" but only steamed rice for 18-30.  Bill for two was just shy of $30.

Lunch time on a Saturday at this location was dead - when we arrived, they were cleaning up a hibachi table that had left a few minutes earlier, and there were two people eating on the sushi side.  They might have sat one more table on the sushi side, and two tables on the hibachi side the hour fifteen we were there.  So very quiet.  But the experience was not lacking for it!  Our waitress took our order very quickly and a hibachi chef was at our table within a few minutes.  I'm sure he's not the best guy they have on staff, but he was nice enough and only made one or two fobbles during his cooking ""show.""  It cured my need for the hibachi experience I missed in Mexico.

Food was very good...especially the fried rice (we sprung for chicken fried rice - a $1 upgrade) and the hibachi steak.  I had the hibachi lemon chicken, which wasn't bad, but I enjoyed the steak more.  The waitress kept our water topped off and stopped by to make sure we were doing okay a few times.",2,"good"
