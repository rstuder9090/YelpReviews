The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",1,"good"

The menu ranges from sushi to bowls with a healthy dose of standard fairs in between. Bubble teas are also available, though I didn't try and of those today.

My lunch partner just wanted something small so he order Miso soup with a few egg rolls.  He said the miso was fantastic and he really enjoyed it.

I opted for a create your own bowl, and was given a card to fill out with all my selections. I ordered my bowl over mixed greens with Korean beef bbq and teriyaki chicken, pineapple, mixed bell peppers, cucumber, sesame seeds, with a light Japanese mayo sauce.

The beef was phenomenal, i loved it! The chicken was really good as well, overall the bowl was really delicious.  The edamame was ok, I should have done the meal option better. If you pick a meal for an extra $3 you get several sides to choose from including the choice of a drink.  Potstickers, soup, egg rolls, and other standards are all part of those options.

Overall I really enjoyed my meal, though the price was a bit higher than i would like for the portion.  I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu offerings.",2,"good"
