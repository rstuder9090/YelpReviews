"2","We are frequent patrons who enjoy their super fun bar, tv's and music selection.  The service is very good.  Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.

Last night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. 

Not to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!

Enjoy!!",1,"good"
"3","We stopped into Pasta Vino for lunch on a whim and it was great!

While the desolate, decaying and shuttered former strip mall across from the entrance is not inviting; look past it and go into the much more inviting interior of Pasta Vino.

Jane, our server, seated us immediately and we smiled at her enthusiasm and personality.

We ordered Pasta Puttanesca and Pasta Carbonara.  The accompanying salad was fresh and good, and my gazpacho was delicious.  Cool, creamy, studded with tomatoes and cucumbers with a perfect touch of spice and drizzle of olive oil.  A small bread basket accompanied our meal and the breads were warm, soft and tasty.

The pastas came hot, al dente and beautifully dressed with their respective, perfectly executed sauces - delicious.  The Puttanesca was redolent of all the elements: a hint of anchovy, olives, tomatoes and my Carbonara was creamy, unctuous and filled with peas and bacon.

I ended with coffee and a fantastic pistachio gelato suggested by Jane.

We will definitely be back to Pasta Vino.",2,"good"
"4","I went to Pasta Vino last night for the first and last time. First I will start with the ambiance. The building they bought was just a bar before and they did not change anything about the inside. There is a huge bar in the middle and tables are about 2 feet from bar goers. For a restaurant like this, I didn't think I'd have to shout to my husband to hear him because of the bar crowd. 

We got the lightly fried calamari which indeed was lightly fried. So lightly that I'm pretty sure half of them were raw. We could eat a couple but had to spit out a few of them. They also fried little sweet potato fries, which was just strange. Some weren't done at all and some where soggy with oil. Just was not a good dish. 

Next was soup and salad. I got the ""clam chowder"". I put it in quotes because nothing about that soup was a clam chowder. It was a very thin white broth with chopped carrots, celery, corn and onions. Notice how I didn't mention clams?  That's because I did not find one clam in the soup. It was basically white vegetable soup.  The broth was also super buttery tasting. Needless to say I only ate about 3 spoons worth. 

The main course was better but not great. I had the mussels in linguine. The mussels were good and the pasta was cooked fine but the sauce that it was in was so thin that it was basically a soup. So thin in fact that it kept splashing on my shirt no matter how careful I was while eating the pasta. I'm hoping my shirt isn't ruined. 

My husband had the scallops and shrimp. He thought overall it was good. Seafood was cooked well but again he thought the sauce was way too thin as well. 

The service was fine. Took a while for the waitress to come back with the check but was mostly attentive. Only complaint about that was she never asked why the calamari and soup weren't  eaten. 

Unfortunately I will not be going back to this establishment. If I want that kind of food for the same price I'll just go down the street to Filomenas.",1,"bad"
"5","First let me start by saying this rating is based solely on the dinner service that my wife, my children, and I had last night.  I had previously been to the establishment 5 or 6 times for lunch/happy hour and the service was alright (still not great but much better than last night).  We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30PM and the place had about 5 tables seated and about 4 people sitting at the bar, so it was pretty dead.  That should mean quick well attended service.  Not the case.  The server took our drink orders and we ordered 2 orders of calamari as starters.  She came back with the drinks and took our entrée orders.  The kids ordered two kids meals and a sushi roll (sushi in an Italian restaurant?), my wife ordered an entrée off the menu, and I ordered one of the specials (crab ravioli w/lobster on top in a blush sauce).  My wife's and my order both came with the choice of salad or soup.  We both chose salad.  So far so good.  Well that is the last part that went normal. About 25 minutes after ordering, the kids entrees showed up at the table.  The server never checked to see if we wanted refills on drinks ( we had to ask her).  Also, we hadn't received any bread, which normally comes out right away there.  So we reminded her about the calamari.  She had a shocked look and then passed the blame asking ""she didn't bring it out?  I thought she was going to get that for me.""  I don't know who ""she"" was, but my guess is she never put the ticket in.  Still no salads yet either.  Next the sushi and drink refills showed up.  Still no calamari.  After about 40 minutes after ordering, the calamari showed up and one salad.  The waitress looked at us in astonishment when we asked where the other salad was and she didn't remember my wife asking for it.  No adult entrees yet and the plates are piling up on the table, and she still didn't ask if anyone needed a refill on drinks.  After almost an hour after ordering the food, the adult entrees came to the table.  Still no salad for my wife.  So we ask again about the salad and again the server looked dumbfounded by the question.  The server heads back to the kitchen to get a salad FINALLY!  As the server is getting the salad, I notice there is no lobster on top of the special that I ordered and then when I bite into the ravioli there is no crab meat.  She brought me regular cheese ravioli in a blush sauce.  When the server finally returned with the salad I showed her that my ""special"" was not what I ordered.  She offered to get me a fresh plate, but I wasn't waiting another 45 minutes or more for that.  I had her take it off the bill and sent the plate back.  She apologized that she was ""flustered"" tonight.  And hey I understand we have bad nights, but this was monumentally bad.  In all the experience has just driven me away from Pasta Vino for good.  By the way I still tipped 15% even though she didn't deserve it.  Oh yeah forgot to mention it was my birthday dinner.",2,"bad"
