"2","I walked by this place for a few months and wasn't sure what it was (bubble tea? restaurant?). Then my friend told me it was sushi/japanese inspired dishes with bubble tea. 

I was intrigued and was going to head over for lunch, but it was raining so i opted for dinner instead. My group of 3 was super hungry so we ordered a variety of things to taste the menu. 

taiwanese salt baked chicken
fried calamari
eel and avocado onigiri
pork sung onigiri
TGI Fresh roll
Angry dragon roll (i think that was the name)
Tonkatsu don
braised beef soup

milk taro black tea
salt foam winter melon green tea

I enjoyed everything we ordered but that might have been because i was hungry. I typically don't order sushi rolls at all but thought since they had so many special rolls that i try to see if they execute them well. I'm more of a chirashi guy 99% of the time. Plus we were sharing so rolls were easier to be family style. 

I liked that the calamari were big and ""meaty"" compared to other places. The taiwanese chicken had the western china style flavors...reminds me of the chicken app over at Shanghai 1..not necessarily a bad thing, but not super amazing. The eel and avocado onigir was pretty good. The pork sung was a let down...i didn't know what 'pork sung' was... for some reason i pictured meat meat... For those wondering, pork sung is the Chinese meat ""wool"" (kinda like cotton). I use to eat that all the time when i was a kid so it wasn't a flavor thing, it was more of a let down because its not really a Japanese ingredient. Its pretty salty (naturally) so it might be good old school app for those interested. 

The two rolls came with soy wrap which is a good change (its flavorless in my opinion so those that don't like seaweed would like it). As always, these special rolls are kinda drowned by American style sauces... They weren't bad, but i'd probably try their chirashi next time to see if they have good fish in general. The rolls i can't really taste the fish. Had good texture though. 

The Tonkasu had the same breading as the calamari (i could be wrong, but tasted very similar). It wasn't anything special. I felt they are frying in a heavier oil or something (calamari and tonkatsu). I tasted my friends braised beef soup. It wasn't a traditional chinese/taiwan flavor profile...the noodles were chewing which i liked, but my friend didn't. I thought the dish was good. 

The salt foam winter melon green tea was pretty bomb. That was the main reason i wanted to come here. There aren't many if any places in philly that serve salt foam (correct me if i'm wrong).I seen it on youtube a few times and really wanted to try it. My friends said their tar tea was ""watered"" down, but i think they got it confused...They thought they were getting a taro tea but it was BLACK TEA with taro flavor. They didn't enjoy it because i think they had a different perception of what they were ordering. I tried it and it was good. They did complain it wasn't cold since it wasn't served with ice. 

Note: My friends said the rice in the onigiri and sushi had way too much rice wine vinegar--so much so that it tasted sour. I honestly didn't taste any at all. I dont' think they use ""real"" sushi rice as the grains are bit off color and size/shape. It isn't a deal breaker to me since i rarely eat rice but others might find fault. One friend said the place is 2 stars, the other 3.5 stars. My overall experience was elevated by the winter melon tea and the great service, so it is a solid 4 stars for me. Food might be 3.5. I would dock a bit more for being cash only. But prices for food were a tad lower than comparable places so you do save on that.",1,"good"
"3","Our go-to sushi restaurant had been Bleu Sushi, but we were intrigued by the rotating light sign of the cute bubble fish out front that shines on the sidewalk.  Fast forward 2 weeks, and finally we got to try their sushi and bubble tea on a late Sunday night!

I was expecting it to be very busy, but we were able to be seated right away.  There is a variety of seating, with tables in the front by the window, to smaller booths, and a lounge area with a big red couch in the middle by the sushi bar and drink station.  We were seated in the very back with round booths, which were very cozy.  I like how it's not too crowded with tables and I felt like it was a deliberate choice to preserve the ambience, with lovely lighting with clear bulbs around the lamps and the dark, cozy feel.  

We ordered:

1. Tuna avocado roll ($5, 8 pieces) - amazing, no fishy taste at all, and the ratio of fish to rice with so high!  Tender and flavorful.  The ratio of fish to avocado was also perfect.

2. Yellowtail roll with jalepeno ($5, 6 pieces) - this was also amazing, with a buttery yellowtail taste that was also not fishy at all.  The jalepeno added a tiny bit of kick and was not overpowering at all.  

3. Bubblefish roll ($10.95, 8 or 10 pieces) - THE BEST THING WE ORDERED.  Spicy crab roll with mango, wrapped with seared salmon and miso glaze.  I could have eaten two of these rolls.  Perfect balance of flavors, tons of crab filling and my favorite part was the seared salmon part on top.  The miso glaze was slightly sweet and added a great finishing touch.  Fresh mango that wasn't too sour provided texture and balance.

4. Taiwanese beef noodle soup - this took awhile to come out.  Large slabs of marbled beef with a clean and mild soup taste.  The noodles were al dente and nicely flavored.  The tea egg was a bit overdone.  Overall not bad, but not a standout either.

Drinks:

5.  Peach green tea ($4.25 without bubbles) - very nice and strong tea taste.  Came in a beer stein.

6.  Bubblefish milk green tea ($4.75 with bubbles) - again, no artificial powdery taste here!  Funny that all the milk drinks were made with lactaid, but I wouldn't have known that unless I read the menu.  Bubbles were soft and chewy, and it came in a cute glass.

Overall, the sushi and drinks make this a standout place to treat yourself after a long and busy work week.  Perfect for hanging out at night with friends or with a significant other.  I want to come back and try the lunch special - 2 rolls for $7.95 (the normal rolls, not the special ones).  I also want to try some of the other things on the menu - the Tuna Avocado and dons will be my next targets!  So excited to come back!",2,"good"
