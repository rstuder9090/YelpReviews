"2","Rarely do you see a five-star review of a nice restaurant on Yelp but here's one that more than warrants its accolades. 

First, I'm a sushi purist so was somewhat skeptical of the info-fusion vibe but the James-Beard nominations, Uchi-esque menu and stellar reviews lured me. 

Glad I was hooked!

The space is unassuming from the outside but once inside you're transported into a super classy yet laid back Asian restaurant. This reminded me a lot of a more modern Uchi from Austin Texas. I heard one of the chefs trained there. 

The host greeted and promptly seated me in the dining room. There is an omakase bar but I couldn't secure a seating on last-minute notice. They were packed. That said if the omakase is like Uchi it's really a melange or their menu so not 100% different as you'd have in an edomae-style restaurant. 

A couple other quick points. Service was excellent. Friendly personable high end and prompt. Food comes relatively quick but is still paced appropriately. 

As you may tell from my other reviews I like to sample a diaspora of the menu. That is a whimsical way of saying I eat a lot. 

1) Shima aji sashimi - excellent way to start, with a sizable portion of shima-aji (in season), very fresh, excellent quality. Knife skills were good (not exceptional, as one piece was stuck to another). What sets this apart is the perfect mix of portion (excellent), quality (excellent), and sauce (perfect). You'll notice in the plating that all the sashimi pieces have some interesting oils, sauces, garnishments, and/or salad components.

2) Green beans with black garlic - have to admit, absolutely loved this. Again, very sizable, American-style portion, but there such an interesting mix of flavors with a lot of onion and spice which I loved. Black garlic is so interesting, too. It was very popular in 2017, but this might bring it back!

This is all a recipe for a 5-star review on Yelp. If I had to ding something is that I'd like to have seen more greens options on the menu. I don't need the obligatory edamame, but some other green salads would be great.

3) Hommaguro sashimi - this was a highlight. You absolutely must get this. Fresh wasabi chili on akami, Chu-toro (out of this world), and o-toro (so buttery) was debonair. I was blown away with the quality. I have had toro when it's a touch grayish on the side when you're dining at off-prime sushi locations, but they get the good stuff here and they must move it fast. Lots of pickles, peppers, and interesting garnishments. I absolutely loved the hijiki salad (sweet dark seaweed), which is uncommon to see.

4) Cabbage salad - I was craving a salad of some sort, but this was too sweet for me. It is a heaping portion, and I respect the inclusion of peanuts which struck as very fusion, however, the candy coating of the nuts was too much for healthy, ol' me (and you my dear reader). They were kind enough to knock this off the addition for me.

5) Sake sashimi - salmon belly sashimi in a light but tasty sauce with a touch of pepper and excellent ikura (salmon roe). Another tell that they utilise high-quality ingredients is that the individual ikura have that little eye at the top. (If you see them a bit flat and all a deep orange color they may be old or heavily processed. This was the opposite.)

6) Seafood laksa - I had heard great things about this dish and wanted something warmer, although the sashimi was not mercifully ice cold as in NY. Tasty curry sauce with good mussels, excellent crispy salmon, and even better ikura as noted above.

7) Isaan hamachi sashimi - Indo's other signature dish. I really enjoyed this, as you had that meaty hamachi paired with a sweetish yuzu sauce, some spice, ginger, etc. It's one of those dishes were you smile while eating it

All-around all-star dining experience in St Louis. The crowd was pleasant and refined, with Midwestern niceties, and an overarching interest and enjoyment in a foodie restaurant. BTW-on the way out, I passed by the omakase bar and everyone was having a splendid there, as well. The General Manager stops at every table, checks that everything is satisfactory and accentuates the cool ambiance of Indo.",1,"good"
"3","November Update: I've made a few more visits to indo, including an omakase. My review not only still stands, but I'd like to add that we need more restaurants such as Indo in STL in order to push its food scene to the next level. 

This was one of the more memorable omakase ive had in any part of the world. I mean that sincerely. While some familiar in-menu favorites were mixed in among the 20+ courses, I was also able to try a variety of snappers I've never had before. Some other standouts include the iwashi (sardine) and the foie gras with candied quinoa. The nigiri and sashimi dishes had uchi-esque inspiration and flavor combination that aren't exactly traditional but so unique. As mentioned below, it is important to note that such flavor profiles simply elevate the main ingredients, not masquerade them. 

My regular menu favorites:
The isaan hamachi, lamb tartare, laksa, and the short rib curry are musts. Their crab rice is not a must order. Yes it's luxurious but not worth the price tag for this one - there are better flavor bombs elsewhere on the menu with better value. On the nigiri side, they have uni from the holy land of uni (Hokkaido), and get their foie gras nigiri if available. 

I'm a fan and I'm looking forward to more meals here.

This was legit good food. Chef Nick is doing St. Louis right. 

Considering that St. Louis is seriously lacking on the Singaporean and Malaysian cuisine front, chef nick does them justice by not just bringing them to the forefront to St. Louis, but elevates their flavors with his own twists. Not only that, in his Japanese inspired dishes, his flavors meld so perfectly with southeastern Asian flavors that it makes you wonder why these haven't been done before!

Cocktail/drink menu: highly diverse. From Asian branded beers to a sommelier-led wine list - it's all there to your liking

Isaan hamachi - my personal favorite which was also a surprise favorite: this dish was just ridiculous.  I love hamachi so with higher expectations for the other dishes we ordered, this arrived first and looked quite humble on size. My initial bite erased all notion of judging a book by its cover. The hamachi was insanely flavorful on its own - fresh with deep hamachi flavor that you wouldn't be able to taste anywhere else in stl. The second notes hit soon after - a Thai curry. What a flavor bomb of a combination.

Uni - specifically ordered the Santa Barbara uni - smooth yet delicate. Very mild but robust. 

Seared salmon belly - a highly anticipated piece of nigiri that would've probably been better off served raw. But it was still immensely fatty and flavorful. 

Shrimp toast - a small homage to my childhood spent in Hong Kong - a snack that was elevated from my childhood. Tasty but compared with the rest of our meal, the most forgettable

Seafood laksa - best bang for the buck and also the most flavorful dish we had. A group favorite. Loved the abundance of shrimp, mussels, and a large piece of skin-on seared salmon. Surprised that noodles were not part of the laksa broth? Our group asked for rice to accompany this dish. The roe brought this laksa to a new level in terms of savoriness and flavor. 

Short rib curry - came with roti and yogurt/olive oil. The yogurt was welcome addition to the immensely rich curry broth and fatty beef. We also asked for extra roti and rice - compliments to the chef for making these dishes so rich and flavorful that we couldn't help but sop these up with extra rice and roti. 

Coconut custard - this was served with flavored shaved ice, lychee flavored boba bursts, and honeydew. While good, it was almost too many different elements all hitting at once. It would've been perfect with just the coconut custard and fresh honeydew.  The lychee flavored boba popping bursts were just tad overkill to an already very well balanced and refreshing dessert. 

No Dungeness crab fat/roe rice tonight. The menu switched it up to a lobster rice so we didn't order it and will have to try the crab rice next time 

I am thoroughly impressed with my meal and I am already trying to fit in a time for an omakase next time around. I am hungry for more of what chef nick has in store.",2,"good"
