This locally owned restaurant has a variety of sushi options as well as dishes from China, Japan, and Korea.  I stopped by for lunch and was impressed with the number of lunch options.  Many of those come with a complementary bowl of Miso soup and a small green salad with ginger dressing.  The soup uses large pieces of seaweed to add extra flavor during the cooking process.  The salad is fresh and is dressed only on the top, but with enough that you can add some flavor to each bite.

I started with the Sashimi (10 pcs of assorted fish).  My colorful plate arrived shortly after I finished my soup and salad.  There were five varieties of fish/seafood arranged over fanned cucumber slices and shredded white carrots.  It also came with lemon slices and an orchid (which is also edible!)  The fish was very fresh and in most cases, very tender.  I think it was the first time I have tried pink tuna, white tuna, and yellowfin tuna at the same sitting, so it was interesting to note how significantly they varied in taste.  The sliced octopus was much tougher to eat (I've never had it raw before) than the tuna probably because it was from the tentacles which are quite muscular.  Still, with a bit of soy sauce, the flavor was quite good.  I finished the platter with the salmon.  Rich and bright, the fish nearly melted in my mouth.  I will definitely get more salmon at a future date.

I also wanted to try a sushi roll and went for the Green Dragon.  This 7 pc roll comes with cucumber and cooked eel inside, and is topped with avocado slices or cooked eel.  Each piece also has a drizzle of ""eel sauce"" (sweet, salty, and savory) under the toppings.  Wow!   This was fantastic!  Highly recommended.

And if you are someone who appreciates a chef's artistry, the plates are so appealingly decorated.  The chef creates Japanese inspired art with the colorful array of sauces at the sushi counter.

The staff/hostess were all very welcoming and checked by during each course to make sure I was enjoying my food.  Nice conversation without being interrupting.  Service was prompt and checkout was a breeze in this full service establishment.

They do have a few non-seafood options available for your friends that may not like traditional seafood or sushi.  

I will mention that the prices are higher than most lunch options in the Greenwood area.  This stand alone business can't get all the discounts of the massive chain restaurants in the area, but the quality is phenomenal and worth treating yourself to.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is tastefully integrated into the industrial strip mall space.  The noise level was in the quiet to moderate range.

"3","Wow!! Am I glad my girlfriend suggested we try Green Ginger in Greenwood. This little restaurant is so easy to drive past sitting off the road in the strip mall. The closest cross roads are Smith Valley Rd
and 135. Don't pass Green Ginger up.

The interior has a small footprint but they have maximized the space well. The interior is nicely decorated and I find the atmosphere warm, inviting, and very soothing.

The service was spot on. The server kept our water, tea and soda filled and used plates removed quickly. We were checked on many times but not intrusive. We spent over two hours here and never once did we feel rushed.

The menu has something for everyone. Every order was fresh and scrumptious! Check out Green Ginger's menu on-line.

On my first visit I went the safe route. I had the lunch Chicken Teriyaki ($9) which came with a refreshing Miso Soup and fresh Green Salad. My friend tried the 8 piece Shrimp Tempura ($10). We really enjoyed both but our curiosity got the best of us. We decided to order the Lobster House Roll ($15) and Spicy Crab Roll ($5) next. I know, our eyes were larger than our stomachs. However, we held our own and proud of the effort! Take out containers were in our future.

I was actually excited to try Green Ginger for the second time. We planned on visiting a new restaurant but we both loved our first visit to Green Ginger. We had to try our favorite, the Lobster House Roll but we decided to try new things. My friend was craving the Green ""Ginger"" Salad ($7) so we had to order. The salad was fresh, crisp and crunchy with a wonderful creamy, ginger dressing. The Lobster House Roll was our favorite during our first visit and we both agreed we must have again. The flavors were amazing with a slight crunch. The Lobster Tempura is delicious by itself, then add avocado, cucumber, with Lobster Salad inside with a red tobiko on top; no idea what red tobiko is but delicious.    

One of the new items we tried was the Seafood Soup for two ($8). Scrumptious!! This was a huge hit for us. The combination of broth, veggies and spices with the seafood was delicious! I love crabmeat, scallops and shrimp which were generous and spot on! So much I ordered a to-go Seafood Soup for 2 for later that evening.

It's not that the Lobster Roll wasn't large enough for two, it was, but I wanted to try the Sunset Roll (10 pieces for $15). We so enjoyed the Spicy Tuna, cream cheese and avocado inside, then the top was deep fried with Spicy Crab. I couldn't resist and happy I tried this wonderful roll.

The prices reflect the fresh fish and ingredients. We usually wouldn't order the quantity of rolls and lunch specials since $60 is insane for a lunch for two. This was a special occasion and we had no boundaries, absolutely! I've already planned our next  visit to try new rolls. I highly recommend Green Ginger for raw or cooked sushi plus an affordable lunch.",2,"good"

 Considering the reviews, I really wanted to like this place. Upon entering the establishment,  it had a relaxing atmosphere... not sure if that was due to the lighting or the fact it was empty and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The lady took our drink order and  brought it out pretty quickly. Shortly after a few other customers  came in. Fast forward 10 minutes  and we are still waiting to order our food. After we order, it had taken  another 15 to 20 minutes before our food got to us. Mind you, everyone had their food already and were already eating before we got anything and we were the FIRST  ones here. As she brought out our food with the help of the other gentleman it was obvious one of our dishes wasn't ordered or was forgotten about as they had spoke to one another in their native language and walked off. Finally the yakisoba was brought out and the only thing in that that was edible was the beef. The female server was very slow and unapologetic.  The water was empty in the cup for the majority of the visit. The food was eh, trust me I've had better.... there are a few things I've learned from my visit here, but the most important thing..
I wont be back for the cost and service 

Dont waste your money  as we are STILL sitting here waiting to get our check

Update- the gentleman took off the yakisoba... thank you for that!",1,"bad"
"5","The filet mignon was dry, likely the ""chef"" didn't let it rest.  It was well done and I ordered rare.  Big disapointment.  Any chef knows that if you go beyond med rare with a filet, it ruins it.   Obviously this ""chef"" doesn't know that.  And who puts that much cilantro on a steak?  There were shitake mushrooms in the dish, one of my favorite mushrooms.  Shitakes are very flavorful, but in this dish you could not taste them.  There was so much salt and teriyaki sauce, it overwhelmed everything but the cilantro that they might as well have used button mushrooms because the shitake taste was buried.  Not to mention, the steak is in a soup of teriyaki sauce. The california rolls had a very strange taste (not good), kind of a chemical taste, which means the tuna is probably not good.  And of course they served the standard and hideous miso soup.  Last but not least, I am a huge black rice fan, so I ordered their black rice.  Unseasoned and WAY over cooked and strangely fishy tasting!  Not much of this meal was edible!  Oh! And here's the kicker!  I am eating the crab rangoons and then bite into a chunk of plastic!  100% of this meal was not edible.",2,"bad"
