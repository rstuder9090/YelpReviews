"2","I've heard good reviews of this restaurant, so I decided to take my mom to lunch and give Daiwa a try.  The decor inside the restaurant is really nice for a westbank sushi restaurant.  Although it was really bright during lunch, I could tell that this place would have a really pretty ambiance during dinner time when the place is darker.  
We were greeted very politely at the door. My mom even commented on how our waitress had a great energy to her and how she seemed to be genuinely sweet.  (I believe her name was Christina).  I thought it was pretty cool how the menus here had loads of pictures, which made ordering extra easy.  
After receiving my Coke in this tiny little bottle, we decided to start our meal off with the Crispy Tofu, Butter and Garlic Scallops, and an order of the Kimchee Udon Noodles.  The Crispy Tofu wasn't very crispy at all.  It was kind of soggy and there was nothing really special about it although it was kinda cool how those thin flakes that is drizzled on top of the tofu seemed to be moving or something.  (Don't ask me why I ordered tofu in a sushi restaurant).  That was my mistake, so I won't really count that one against them.  The scallops on the other hand were perfectly seared and seasoned and was topped off with those stringy mushrooms.  I actually prefer the scallops to be plated over a bed of greens the way Rock N Sake does it, but the stringy mushrooms wasn't bad at all.  

The Kimchee Udon Noodles was the BOMB though!  I plan on coming back to this place just for the Kimchee Udon Noodles.  It is a little pricey though at $9 a bowl and the portion was pretty small.  
I decided to try the Australian Lobster roll and the Cowboy roll.  I was a little disappointed with the Lobster roll because quite a few of my friends suggested that roll.  I thought it was a little weird to roll some lettuce into the roll.  I felt like the lettuce was overpowering and sort of took away from the roll.  Now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't just pick the lettuce out to see how it would taste without it?  *Brainfart*
The Cowboy roll was good but not great.  We only ordered two rolls, so I can't judge the place based on 2 rolls.  It was partly my fault for venturing out and trying different combinations on the sushi rolls.  I definitely plan on trying more rolls the next time I come back for their Kimchee Udon Noodles.  I also plan on coming back at dinner time to experience the moody lighting. =)",1,"good"
"3","Willing to go out of your way for good eats? Of course you do; you're reading Yelp. Head to the West Bank and check out Daiwa! This new Japanese restaurant opened last month and is already gaining popularity by word of mouth.

You might recognize sushi chef and owner Ken Wong from behind the bar at Hana and various Little Tokyo locations, most recently LT Uptown (with me! The funnest and second-clumsiest server they've ever had). Named after the famous Daiwa Sushi restaurant in Tsukiji, Japan, Daiwa serves well-priced sushi rolls, lunch and dinner specials, and a smattering of chef specialties and yakitori.

A group of my former Little Tokyo Uptown co-workers and I headed over this week to support our friend's new venture and both stomachs and wallets appreciated the endeavor. I don't have good pictures of the interiors, but it is brightly lit (which I personally like, as it makes for better photography), with a hand painted cherry branch mural on the wall and Ikea orb lanterns dangling throughout.

The following dishes were split among the 5 of us and filled us all up nicely. Full disclosure: We paid for everything at full-price, no discount, except the complimentary dessert and small-dish sample of glass noodles. Onto the food!

Squid steak: I enjoyed the legs most because I like my calamari charred and crisp. Only complaint, I wish the onions had come cooked or carmelized, as they didn't have enough time on the iron platter .

Baked mussels: Standardly flavored with salmon roe and cream, the chopped pieces of mussels added a nice chew to the sweet sauce.

Agedashi tofu: One of my favorite dishes from Japanese restaurants anywhere, these blocks of tender yet firm tofu are lightly battered and fried, then topped with bonito flakes and chives, served with soy sauce. Nummy nummy!

Cowboy roll: crawfish inside, seared rare steak on the outside - Here is the first of the specialty rolls we tried, the Cowboy Roll. I personally don't like crawfish in my sushi, but I appreciated it's slight spice as contrasted with the delicious, lightly seared beef.

Salmon yogurt roll: Raw salmon, shrimp tempura, salad greens wrapped in Vietnamese rice paper, topped with sweet/tangy yogurt sauce. No rice. - I didn't think I would like this because sweet foods bother me so it was a nice surprise. This was more like goi cuon (Vietnamese spring roll) than a traditional sushi roll. The fresh salad greens with crispy shrimp and supple raw salmon, flavored only slightly with the sweet yogurt sauce, mixed yummily in my mouth. I hate sauce-doused sushi (like so many places in the NOLA do); a light drizzle works perfectly for me.

Sample of a new dish: glass noodles and kimchi. -  While waiting for our next dish, Ken brought out a small sample of a new dish: spicy kimchi glass noodles with chilled cucumber. It reminds me of childhood cold noodle dishes that you buy on the street in Taiwan. Fun note: glass noodles are made with mung beans so they have absolutely no carbohydrates.

Kimchi and hamachi roll  - I didn't try this because I didn't want to. I mean, I like hamachi as sashimi; I'm just not a big fan of like spicy tuna-like preparations. Looked good though, especially if you like kimchi.

 BBQ eel hibachi rice - I was feeling hungry and wanted rice to fill up at this point, so Ken recommended this dish. Probably one of the best hibachi rices I've ever had, with the fatty and meaty eel morsels counterpointing the rice.

Negimaki: Thinly sliced rare beef wrapped around green onion and grilled - Another yakitori dish of grilled beef and green onion. I could probably eat like 3 plates of this.

Salmon salad - Didn't eat the salad, it was pretty much romaine lettuce with raw salmon diced on top. It looked very nice. 

Tofu pudding, topped with strawberry, peach, and blueberry - Last, we enjoyed a dessert of almond tofu jello pudding. A little firmer than flan, slightly saccharine, and topped with fruit and drizzled with chocolate sauce, this was a fitting end. We actually couldn't finish all of them.

Daiwa's location is a little ways out there but I think it's worth making the West Bank Field Trip for. There are so many dishes I want to try. Can I also mention that they have a full bento box lunch special for $8?",2,"good"
