"2","TL;DR verdict: lovely little place with good food.

Atmosphere: decorations were an interesting mix of tacky and elegant. The music was not the usual generic random-Asian-string-instrument, but J-pop! And artists I actually knew, such as X Japan and Hamasaki Ayumi.

Service: attentive, polite, helpful.

And the food! Yummy. (Yes, I went there.) I ordered an $11 three-roll sushi lunch, with East, Spicy Salmon and Eel Rolls. All were delicious, I didn't even need to wasabi or soy sauce. My friends ordered the cheaper yakisoba and shrimp tempura lunches, which were ""quite good"" and ""great"" respectively. The tempura breading was also ""fabulous"" but the sauce that came with it too vinegary. All lunch specials came with miso soup and salad, which were not outstanding, but satisfying.

Two appetizers, yakitori and beef negimaki, were also enjoyed. Great char on the bottom of the negimaki, and the presentation was fun. We only received two skewers of yakitori, sadly, and had to divide them; the chicken was somewhat bland but the vegetables (green peppers, mushrooms, onions) made up for it.

After our food was finished, or packed up in doggy bags (stapled even! how nice of them) we were handed a complimentary plate of fried(?) breaded(?) banana drizzled in lime(?) green sauce. Well, whatever it was, I ate most of it. Beautiful texture and flavor, especially with their lovely whipped cream.

Even after all that, we ordered a dessert to share- they have quite the selection! Thus, the deliciously decadent chocolate truffle, sized somewhat like a tennis ball. Composed of gelato and cocoa dusting, among other things, and topped with more of that whipped cream and a cherry- mmmmm. Next time, I want to try a bomba- and there will be a next time, if I have anything to say about it.",1,"good"
"3","Wow, what can I say? I first saw this restaurant while looking for a shoe store in Burlington Mall.  Someone from Moorestown Mall directed us to Burlington.  I didn't think much of this place when I first saw it, I did however, went in and asked for a take-home menu.  Yesterday my girl and I went to try it out.  Hands down, this place have one of the best sushi I've ever tried anywhere.  Not only does it taste good but their plating is amazing.  The chef hand drawn a whole dragon with eel sauce and the  Hawaiian roll came out with flashing lights on the actual plate.  I know someone mentioned this before in their review but it's really that amazing when you see it in person.  If you want sushi, this is the place to be.  I haven't really tried their hot food but the salmon hibachi I got wasn't all that.  The hibachi came with fried rice and two shrimps.  The shrimps were pretty good (that's what my girl told me) but the dish itself had too sauce for a hibachi.  The fried rice isn't all that either.  Go here for sushi, I can vouch for that, just make sure you don't over order, they are generous with the sushi.",2,"good"
