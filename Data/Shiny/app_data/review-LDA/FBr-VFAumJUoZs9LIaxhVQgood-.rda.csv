"2","Grabbed lunch here on a Friday since the food truck was outside my work for the day. I've heard rave reviews about the poke bowls from friends who have had their food before outside breweries around the St. Pete area so I was eager to try them for myself. I ordered a Krab bowl with all the veggie toppings (minus onions) and had the Ikiruka(?) sauce and Atomic sauce on the side. My co-workers each ordered a bowl with different proteins (tuna and coconut shrimp). We were able to pay with a card, and I believe they took cash as well. 

The food was done within 5 minutes and packaged in convenient to-go cartons that were resealable and reusable. The food truck provided soy sauce and utensils as well. The food was very fresh and a decent portion size for $10. My Krab was good, but I tried some of my friend's coconut shrimp and would definitely get that instead next time. They are generous with the toppings and the seaweed salad and corn were my favorites. The only one I did not care for was the mango. They tasted like canned peaches and everyone in my group confirmed this. I would come back here and try some other combinations or even opt for a sushi burrito next time.

Reason for a star deduction:
- Don't sell beverages
- Mango (aka Peaches)  were definitely canned. 
- Soy sauce was off-brand and tasted weird",1,"good"
"3","Lured by the great reviews for the fresh sushi and delicious bowls, we stopped by for our first visit. A very hole- in -the- strip- mall  space  with a super casual vibe, a beautiful mural on the wall and  super friendly staff to greet us. It's  a take out and/or order at the counter kind of  place with lots of open table seating. Our orders came out  in mere minutes. I had an absolutely delicious tuna bowl with super fresh veggies and ikigai sauce (tangy and hot) They have huge rice cookers and their sushi rice is incredible! We also ordered spicy tuna roll, kamikaze, volcano and spicy salmon rolls. They were amazing! The sushi is incredibly fresh and we loved the convenience of sitting down quickly and having a great meal. This place is great if you want a super quick, super delicious casual sushi meal...or try the bowls! Yum! A new favorite in town!",2,"good"
