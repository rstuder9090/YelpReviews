"2","I was well on my way to a revisit of Newk's Eatery across the street when I picked up the Yelp app to check out the area restaurants. I spied Community Manager Niki's review and laughed when she described the atmosphere of Daddy Jack's as outdated. Since I'm a good 20+ years older than Niki, I figured Daddy Jack's would be perfect for me. Strangely enough, Daddy Jack's ended up being almost exactly what I expected. 

Thanks, Niki!

So, instead of Newk's I headed into the strip center housing Daddy Jack's and its sister restaurant, the somewhat more higher end Kona Jack's. This strip center has always been a little odd in terms of wheelchair access - it basically has it, but it's not actually ADA compliant as the parking spots don't have the metal signs and the curb cuts, while decent enough, are in kind of odd locations. Once I found a spot, however, I had a curb cut nearby and almost directly in front of Daddy Jack's. The covered entrance has a glass door entryway and I was impressed that someone was at the door ready to greet me. 

At first, I thought I might be looking at an inaccessible restaurant. As you enter, there's a hosting area to your left and a large bar area to your right. To your left, there's a row of tables. However, all of it is elevated - even the hosting area. It's kind of odd. However, I was relieved to find out they have an area in the back that includes regular tables that are accessible. However, you should note that you have to wheel through the narrow aisle next to the bar to get to them - it's kind of tight even in my smaller, manual chair. People were perfectly friendly, but if the place had been packed it would have been challenging. 

I was seated at one of the tables in the backs, televisions are on the wall with overhead music playing a mixture of oldies and pop/rock. My server, Cindy E., was a rock star and is largely the reason for the 4-star rating. The menu includes a variety of meal/sandwich options and you can also order the famed sushi from next door at Kona Jack's. 

I ordered a B.Y.O. burger, medium well. It comes with chips, though for $2 you can upgrade to a side. I opted to upgrade to steak fries. I contemplated a nicer meal, but really was in the mood for simple and a quality burger sounded good. With my usual unsweetened iced tea, the bill came in at just over $16 - not bad, but definitely a bit of a splurge. It's fairly average in terms of value as the burger, served on a sesame seed bun, is a good sized burger but the steak fries struck me as a bit slight for a $2 upcharge and I doubt I'd order them again. 

The burger was delivered as ordered, a nice sandwich that satisfied me and was definitely worthy of the $10.50 charge. My iced tea was refilled once and I was given one to go. 

Even though I'm 20+ years older than Niki, I tend to agree with Niki on the atmosphere. It has a retro-steakhouse/bar type feeling, but the tables in the back are fairly packed in and it lacks the relaxed, casual feeling of those types of bar/grill joints. It wasn't uncomfortable at all - it just wasn't nearly as comfortable as I'd expect. That, coupled with the accessibility concerns would likely keep me from adding Daddy Jack's to my regular rotation. 

Overall, I wrestled with 3-4 stars. When a place doesn't quite make my usual rotation, then I usually defer to 3 stars. However, I really liked the service here and the food was solid if a bit slight in terms of value. I would probably go 3.5 if I could, but 3 stars simply feels to low. So, 4 stars it is with the disclaimer that this would be more of an occasional, splurge type setting for me than a regular spot. However, if you're in the area and in the mood for something a little finer than a Newk's or a McAlister's then this may very well be a great place to try.",1,"good"
"3","It has been years since I've left a review for Daddy Jack's and it's time to update.

Daddy Jack's is located in the Lifetime Fitness strip center close to the intersection on Meridian and 96th Street (East side of Meridian). Parking has changed with the Pandemic and all the front row parking is now reserved for carry-out or curbside service. Of course, the large parking lot provides an abundance of free parking.

The elevated hostess stand is on the left as you enter. The cozy interior still has lots of warm woods, tables and chairs in the back with banquette booth seating along with full booths. A large bar is in the center of the main dining room filled with regulars grabbing a drink and/or dining. Six flatscreens are located throughout the restaurant. The isleway is narrow getting to the back tables or the 2nd dining room but doable.

We have been here several times in the past few weeks and found the service has greatly improved and the food has been delicious. They serve lunch and dinner with a menu offering appetizers, excellent Clam chowder, salads, burgers, sandwiches, hand-cut steaks, seafood, chicken and pasta dishes. Kona Jack's is just next door and you'll receive a sushi menu as well as the regular dinner menu.

A few items we've ordered is the amazing Blacken Tenderloin Sandwich (seriously and deliciously blacken), the Seafood Fettuccine with tender scallops, crab, shrimp in a light cream sauce. The Seafood Diavola is my favorite with shrimp and scallops tossed with Cajun Seasoning, marinated tomatoes, basil, garlic, red onions with linguine noodles. I asked for extra Cajun Seasoning to add a touch more heat.

Daddy Jack's has been in business for over 30 years and the food was terrific, the service was on the money and we had a pleasant meal. Drop in and give it a try if you haven't.",2,"good"
