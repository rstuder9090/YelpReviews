"2","Was really craving Pad Thai and found this spot on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  It was about 45mins prior to their closing so we placed the order online and headed right over to pick it up.

The restaurant is off the side of a main road, and is very easy to drive right by if you're not paying attention -- so be attentive and slow down early.

There are about three parking spots in front and a few more to the left of the building.  Due to COVID they are only doing take out and delivery, with the option of eating your food on one of their outside bench tables, with an umbrella to help block the sun.

I ordered a tofu and shrimp pad thai which came out to be about $14.  The portion size here is definitely for a family as the pad thai lasted me for 4 meals!  The Thai Hot was spicy and had good flavor but I feel it completely took away from the other flavors pad thai should have; e.g. tamarind.  Nonetheless the pad thai was great here and I would definitely order it again.

The following day, because the pad thai was so good, I wanted to try something else on their menu.  So I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken in medium this time.  Same deal here with the portion size, although this one lasted me only 3 meals -- thinking it was the extra protein that allows for an extra meal.  The flavor was great, but the heat for medium was not hot enough, so thinking next time I'll try their hot (in between medium and Thai hot).

If you're in the area and craving Thai food, so far, this is the place to beat.",1,"good"
"3","I ordered take-out from Thai 5 after reading many stellar reviews and was quite pleased with my decision! The Crab Rangoon - which is served with Thai sweet chili sauce - was a very tasty starter; I wished the wonton ends were less crispy/hard, but I happily ate the center stuffing and it was delicious! 

After learning from Yelp that the Crab fried rice and Pumpkin Panang Curry were popular entree choices, I decided that I wanted to try both. So I asked the gentleman over the phone if I could order the Pumpkin Panang with chicken and jasmine rice - as well as a side of the crab fried rice (since I really just wanted to try it). Since the menu did not reflect the ability to add side orders, he kindly indicated that he could input a ""half portion"" - which was fine by me. The half portion ended up being HUGE (basically seemed like a full entree serving...just see the picture I uploaded if you're in doubt). 

I appreciated Thai 5's flexibility by graciously accommodating my request.  This showed me that their customer service efforts are truly exceptional. He asked if I wanted the regular fried rice or the spicy fried rice. I didn't recall reading about the spicy fried rice on Yelp or on the menu, so I asked for his opinion. He said that the spicy kind is more popular and that it would be good with the crab. As it turns out, I absolutely HATED the spicy fried rice with crab. I took two bites and ended up tossing the whole thing. Rather than discrediting the restaurant for this, I attributed this experience to my personal taste. It was way too peppery and the spices really took away from the taste of egg and other ingredients (an appeal that fried rice traditionally offers). I also wondered if I was more adverse to the seafood aspect of this dish - this was a dish that I just wanted to try, and now I know, the crab spicy fried rice is not for me. 

The Pumpkin Panang with chicken, on the other hand was DELICIOUS! I love that this entree is available year round (since many restaurants only offer Pumpkin flavored entrees during the fall season). This was the first Thai restaurant I have ordered from in Tampa that has offered the Pumpkin Panang flavor. The dish could have been slightly sweeter and the potatoes were too soft to stick my fork into, but the consistency of the sauce and the generous serving of chicken was just enough to satiate my appetite!  

I'll definitely be back with the hopes of trying their coconut rice and more of what Thai 5 has to offer!",2,"good"
