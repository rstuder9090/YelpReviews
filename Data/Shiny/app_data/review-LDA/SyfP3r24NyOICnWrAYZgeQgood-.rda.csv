"2","I'd really been wanting to try this place for awhile after reading so many positive Yelp reviews. This place lived up to all the expectations.

We started off with chicken satay for me and shrimp Tom Yum soup for T. He absolutely loved his soup and the chicken satay was amazing (not to mention HUGE). The chicken was really flavorful, tasted like it was grilled over a wood fire. The peanut sauce wasn't too sweet or overwhelming. It was served with a little salad of carrots, cucumbers and mixed greens with a tangy vinaigrette.

We both ordered sushi for dinner. He had the spicy tuna, eel and avocado and two pieces of yellowtail sushi. I had the fusion roll and a Philadelphia roll. The fusion roll was absolutely amazing. Tons of fresh spicy tuna on top of a crispy tempura shrimp roll drizzled with eel sauce. What a great combination of flavors! It was quickly devoured. The Philadelphia roll was equally good. Lots of fresh smoked salmon and crunchy cumcumber. I also had a piece of the eel and it was great. Not chewy at all and I really liked the creamy avocado with it. 

Not only was the food good, the service was great. 

This place was just as good as we wanted it to be! It's BYOB so don't forget wine or some other adult beverages if that's your thing. Another great local haunt for us that's close to our new home!",1,"good"
"3","I was on my way to Pho & Beyond with my mom when I was like, ""Hey do you want to try 'La Fusion' instead?"" So we gave it a shot. I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. 

We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai  - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai. 

The decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant. I saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special - but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option.  It's all good though. 

Cons: I think it's a bit overpriced given it's location. If we were in the city it would make sense, but not at Willow Grove. 

Lack of parking - maybe like 6 or 7 spots? We parked at the Pho & beyond shopping complex - and walked over. I think they should add another door near the back of their restaurant (just a suggestion).  If they have a deal with the bank to park there...they should have a clear, huge sign that parking is allowed at the bank after a certain time. 

I don't know if it is lack of parking, the weekday, or the $$$, but it was really empty inside the restaurant at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night. It was a bit awkward. 

The Olive Garden across the street was overflowing with people waiting outside. It was just awkward. Maybe they should have a groupon deal or something so more people can come to this place. 

Would I go back again? I think for the Crispy Duck - yes.

[Edit]: I received a message from a fellow yelper that on the Saturday they went, there was a 30-45 minute wait. Since I loved the Crispy Duck so much I've decided to have my birthday dinner there. Will keep you posted.",2,"good"
