"2","Marketing idea - sell souvenir Thida Thai tie-dyed Thai ties!

But I bet it would be hard to tie a Thida Thai tie-dyed Thai tie.

For my birthday my daughter and son-in-law wanted to take my wife and I out to eat. They frequent here often and I have wanted to try it based on their reviews as well as my mother-in-laws. It is quaint and unassuming - quite place to relax. We didn't have to wait for a table, which was kind of strange based on the quality and flavor of the food. I got the Pad Thai and got some on my Thai tie-dyed...sorry, time to get off that pony...

Anything on the menu you can adjust the heat/spice level. I ordered my green tea ice cream extra spicy...OK seriously, being adventurous I chose the Pad Thai at heat level 5 - excellent choice! Noodles cooked just right. At lots of places either your food is hot with no flavor or lots of flavor but no heat. This had a perfect balance. I reviewed a hot chicken place last week that was high on heat, but the flavor was not there. There was one green curry and one red curry ordered by the family - I forgot the name of what my wife ordered, but it was similar to a bamboo chicken dish served at Omni Hut, but with more vegetables. All were excellent! Crab Rangoon was really tasty as were the spring rolls - dishes presented very nicely with carved veggies and such. Service was excellent as well.

I have been craving their Pad Thai since our visit - almost went the next day. Think I'll go shrimp next time...then beef the next day or maybe pork...or both...",1,"good"
"3","Thai your mother down, Thai your mother down - (those are sorta lyrics from a Queen song - I'm not a pyschopath). Gonna have to stop reviewing Thai restaurants because I am running out of Thai puns - Thai pun DOH! The well isn't dry!

We had attended the first Sunday service at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch since the mass shooting had taken place. I used to be the youth minister and one of the song leaders there. The minister that was shot was my wife's youth minister in the 70's and she was involved with the children's ministry. The hero was in my youth group. You might be thinking, ""You just left such a somber occasion and you are making jokes?"" Well, you should have heard the minister! He has always used humor in his sermons. ""Well, I guess I won't be giving anymore 5 point sermons!"" He had his index finger completely shot off. He made reference to a nearby church opening its doors so parishioners would have a place to stay while the investigation was going on - to which he stated, ""I didn't go."" He was rushed to the hospital. He shared that a fellow school basketball coach told him he couldn't number one anymore.  He had called my wife a few weeks before asking her to come visit him (her best friend goes there). His first words to her - ""I guess I have to get shot for you to come see me!"" Afterwards I walked up to him - ""HIGH FOUR!"" He told everyone after the service that he wanted to talk to each and every one and would be sitting up front. ""The news people want to talk to me, but they can wait - they're getting paid."" He WILL turn tragedy into triump...

Back to the review after that brief interruption - didn't want you to think I am callous - I have a couple, but I'm not (another pun if you are keeping count). Our daughter and her husband and probably the cutest eleven month old grandson in the world met us there. We stayed for the news interviews and were there until about 1:30. We asked the kids if they wanted to eat with us - they did. I suggested KFC - they all suggested I think again. I suggested deli subs from Publix, they suggested I go change the baby's diaper. After changing the messy diaper I got this unexplainable urge for a refried bean burrito so I suggested Taco Bell - they all suggested I shut up. Our daughter suggested Thida Thai - I guess a three fourths majority rules - no bean burrito with extra onions and fire sauce for me this day.

None of us have been since they moved to their new location. I had written a previous review, but it was from the old location. This new place is, and I cannot help re-using this word for them - AWESOME! Anything else would be a disservice. We chose to sit outside under the covered section of the patio. While it was hot in the sun, under here, with a breeze blowing, it was perfect! The owner recognized our kids from when they used to go to the old location quite a bit. She didn't recognize me - why didn't she recognize me? Give me a minute....my feelings are hurt....OK, I'm better, my grandson gave me a hug. We also order 2 orders of egg rolls and one crab Rangoon - delicious as always. For entrees we all ordered something different - wait that's not true. Yes it is - even though the three of them order the exact same thing - it was something they had never had, so that makes it different - right? I guess they all had the same thing only different - you decide. Since I am the only one that TRULY got something different, let's start with me - I had the Rad Nah. Oh man was it good! It was like getting an entr√©e and soup all in one dish. ""How on earth am I going to eat all that?!"" As it turned out - one spoonful at a time. They all got the Green Dragon Vegetable Roll that came with salad and Miso soup. Miso glad they did - I told you the well wasn't dry! Did they like it? Well, sorta - OK I'm kidding the LOVED it - my wife especially. YAY! I really enjoy this place and she is trying to eat lighter, fresher - so be back soon.  OH! On another review site, I had written a review of another Thai place where I had ordered Pad Prik. They edit their reviews for possible offensive referenced - I had to prove to them  - that I wasn't a 12 year old boy I guess - and that was indeed the name of the dish!",2,"good"
"4","Stopped in to this place, it's an hour from our home, and ordered several items:

Fried dumpling appetizer 
Vegetable Tom Kha
Soft shell crab entree with curry
Papaya salad 
Pad thai with chicken

Here are the facts... low key spot, friendly enough staff, nicely decorated restrooms. Fried dumplings were good, tom kha was flavorful, pad thai tasty (""good as any I ever had"" according to my husband), things were going great. Then my husband stopped focusing on me and what I was saying, he also stopped eating. He was zoned in on the wall behind me, we were sitting near the window to the left when you walk in. I turned to see what he was looking at with a disgusted look, and to my surprise it was a roach. A quick moving roach, with long antennae that blended into the brown trim of the seat.

I immediately grabbed my jacket to shake it vigorously, handed my hubby his baseball cap, and stood up. We didn't make a scene, no one was near us, though there were several folks dining. Instead, we signaled our waitress who inquired if something was wrong, at which point I shared in a lowered voice you have roaches (because everyone knows where you have one you have many breeding behind the walls and spreading disease when the lights are off). However, my identifying the pest for her which left me visibly disturbed, left her completely unfazed. Her response wasn't, I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do, or I apologize for this disruption in your meal let me comp a portion of the bill, (I hadn't touched my soft shell entree), instead her response was epic. She said, ""it's because of the rain."" I didn't want to be disrespectful and laugh in her face. So, instead, I said ""no you have roaches."" 

Another staff member came over, and inquired if everything was OK?  In which we again low key shared there is a roach. She was apologetic, but not to the point of reducing the meal by a %, which was reasonable given that we were no more than 10 minutes into our entrees, and again I hadn't even started my entree. Mainly because they brought everything out at the same time, instead of pacing the meal. Our entrees had to sit on a neighboring table because everything came out so fast, leaving us to either inhale our starters or risk cold food. Neither option is ideal.

All in all, we won't go back due to the roach issue. The lacidasical and ridiculous reasoning the waitress provided is simply the icing on the back of the brown roach with extra long antennae that must have come in ""because of the rain"".",1,"bad"
"5","I'm not sure what the hype is about... I recently dined at Thida Thai's new location with my parents. I haven't eaten at this restaurant several years, so I am basically treating this experience like it's my first time there. Firstly, service and staff are very friendly and attentive. The ambience and decor was also very well put together, so no complaints there. I guess my biggest qualm with this place is that I felt like the flavors of every dish we ordered seemed a bit off.

Keep in mind that I am VERY picky with Thai and Lao restaurants, as I am Lao and used to eating the authentic stuff. I ordered Lad Nah, and I wasn't crazy about the flavor because it was too sweet and had sesame oil in it, which is not common. Also, instead of Chinese broccoli, it had carrots and cabbage?? I don't know... My mom ordered Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and it was made without Thai basil, which is the star ingredient of Pad Kee Mao in my opinion. Pad Khing (ginger stir fry) was also too salty. 

My parents took a chance and ordered creme brulee for dessert, and the risk definitely did not pay off. Underneath the torched crust topping was a mushy pudding with whipped cream on top. Meh. 

Like I said, all the Thai food seemed off, like the flavors have been adjusted from the traditional Thai palette. I haven't tried the sushi, but I suppose that will be my next venture, as I'm not inclined to eat Thai food here again.",2,"bad"
