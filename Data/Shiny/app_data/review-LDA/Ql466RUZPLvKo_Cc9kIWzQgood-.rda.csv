"2","This is the place you want to go for solid sushi at cheap prices.  It's not cheap food, it's good food for cheap prices.  We were one of two couples on a Friday night so the ambiance is very low key.  Lots of people do lunch or take-out.  My wife is a fan of that.  We split 4 rolls, and 2 apps for $57 w/ tip, and brought a bottle of wine (obviously BYOB).  Would definitely go back when we have a sushi craving and want to not have a big night out.  Small parties of no more than 6-8 by the looks of it.  Nice service.  I saw other reviews that were critical, but you can't go in here with the expectation you're getting gourmet sushi.  It's good sushi that doesn't break the bank.  Feel like I said that theme enough.",1,"good"
"3","We love this place!!! Extremely kid friendly- my son loves the spring rolls and rice. We love the sushi  especially for the price. My mother gets the beef with vegetables and you get a lot of beef AND vegetables.  It's byob but have hot sake and beer for 3$ you can't beat that.  They have a new roll with white tuna that is yummy. We usually get the same rolls over and over such as Tiffany maki, red dragon , Godzilla,volcano and of course crunchy spicy tuna or salmon ALL always good. Sometimes you have to stay on top of them for service but they try super hard and are very friendly.",2,"good"
