"2","Unagi & Sushi is my favorite place to get sushi in Metairie area. The special rolls could be pretty pricey so I don't go there as often as I used to. This place is located right next to Rouse's on Airline near the Cox Communications building. This used to be the place of WoW Wingery.

As one of the reviewers previously mentioned, the interior in this joint looks very simple, and the place looks clean.

If you choose to dine in, they serve you with their complimentary noodle salad (clear noodles with white sauce and sesame seeds) in a small plate. This tastes good.

I haven't really tried their whole menu so far.  But when I go there I always go for their Hollywood Roll or Funky Margarita Roll.

The Hollywood Roll is a snowcrab-based roll with shrimp tempura in the middle, smelt roe, wrapped in soy paper with the right amount of their mayo-based spicy sauce. There is no sushi rice in this roll. If you like crunchy, don't forget to tell them to add their crunchy flakes with the roll. I found that the crunchy improves the overall taste of the Hollywood Roll. You can choose to have the crunchy on top or inside of the roll. Their crunchy flakes taste different than the crunchy in most sushi restaurants around. The crunchy flakes at Unagi & Sushi taste salty, not tasteless as in many restaurants.

The Funky Margarita roll is what really got me hooked to Unagi & Sushi. You can choose to have either crawfish or spicy tuna in this roll. I try to tell them to make it with crawfish but if I did not tell them it'll come with spicy tuna. I just prefer crawfish to go with this roll. The crawfish or spicy tuna is wrapped in seaweed then sushi rice.The roll is topped with guacamole sauce, crunchy, and some eel sauce. When I first read the menu, I was kind of skeptical about having guacamole in sushi. But I guess the people at Unagi & Sushi would not put it on the menu if it does not taste great. The onion in the guacamole can be pretty strong. So chew some gums if you happen to have this for lunch and need to go back to work afterwards. :)",1,"good"
"3","I've mostly stuck to one sushi place in town over the last six or seven years. Because of this, there is a feeling of wonder in striking out to brave a new restaurant and finding an excellent meal. Unagi & Sushi has been on my radar for awhile. I mean, I am in love with unagi, and it's literally in the name! I ordered a large hot sake, some eel sashimi, and the special crunchy roll. The portions were nice, the price was fair, and the first bite was oh so satisfying. Eel is one of those things that has to be cooked perfectly: the sauce has to be well-balanced in flavor and portioned correctly, the meat has to be so soft it melts in your mouth, and the consistency must be uniform without a bone to be tasted. This hit all three marks right on target. I already find myself wishing I had taken pictures of the carrot butterfly and flowers that adorned the plate. Maybe next time I'll snap a few photos.

The roll was so good I tried another, the eel special, and again was sent to unagi heaven. I got desert, green tea mochi ice cream, and it was so soft and tasty! The mochi was doughy and the ice cream was smooth, all th best consistency and outlined with whipped cream and sprinkles!

All I can say is if you like eel like I do, and want something that is made with care, please try this place out!",2,"good"
"4","I've always noticed this place when I go to Rouses and I always end up thinking ""oh what a good location for a sushi place: this is great i can pick up sushi after i shop that's a little 'higher quality' than the stuff in the grocery store"".. but then I end up not wanting to go through the effort and head to the sushi counter anyway. I finally decided to give them a try recently. 
It was my first time ordering so I pulled up the menu at home on my laptop and called in my order (a snow crab roll and a valentine roll). When I called the guy who answered seemed to be in quite a rush, which.. I get it, his job is probably really stressful sometimes. I said what I wanted and he immediately answered ""Ok 20 minutes"" then hung up. Didn't ask for my name but I figured whatever maybe they just go off phone number or something? and I tried to kill the ""this isn't going to end well"" spidey sense that was creeping over me. Sushi isn't like pizza or something where food temperature matters (at least to me) so I made it a point to show up at exactly 20 minutes like the phone answerer had told me hoping to avoid having to sit around too long. 
I went in and the same guy who I talked to on the phone was there (recognized the voice and the bristly manner). I told him I was picking up and he repeated my order to me but said something else instead of the valentine roll. I told him that was wrong and he once again repeated the other roll and started to act like he was frustrated with me. I'm not sure what he was expecting from me. He kept repeating it like he wanted me to just accept the new roll. I thought for a split second that maybe that roll was very similar to the one I ordered? and he thought I should just take it? I'd never been there before though and didn't exactly have the menu memorized enough to know if it was close.
Eventually he just kind of sighed and took the to go box over to the sushi chefs at the bar. He mumbled something at them and started to walk away. ""They're making it now, sit down"" he said. I didn't really care that he'd misheard me on the phone and I didn't mind waiting, but his attitude was really putting me off. I wasn't sure how long it would take them to make my roll and thought maybe I could kill the time in Rouses and get a drink real quick so I asked him if he knew about how long the wait would be. He again seemed really frustrated with me and just said ""Sit down, they're making it now.""
Well, I sat down. Maybe 4-5 minutes later he gave me my order and I left. I was hoping maybe the quality of the food would redeem what was already a pretty terrible experience. The sushi was... ok. The snowcrab roll was pretty tiny. The valentine roll was a little more substantial but the pieces of actual fish in it were SO tiny. Like comically tiny. I just got the impression that the place is stingy with their ingredients. The prices weren't THAT cheap, it was a big turn off. 
In the end the rolls weren't the worst I've ever had but considering the stinginess and the awful attitude of the host/waiter/whatever that guy's job title is you're really better off just going into Rouses.",1,"bad"
"5","While heading to get some Mardi Gras supplies nearby I finally stopped for lunch at Unagi. Overall it was a mixed bag.

I like that I was given a small bowl of a noodle salad (just like Mikimoto, but not as good) when I was seated. I ordered the lunch roll combination and a squid salad. First out was a bowl of miso soup. Miso is very hard to do wrong and still hard to do really well. Most places have just middle of the road miso soup and I often use it as the first measure of the quality of a sushi restaurant. Unagi produced a barely mediocre miso soup. I didn't bother with the house salad that came with my combination but I did enjoy the squid salad. Then again, it's pre-packaged so all they had to do was put it in a bowl.

The lunch roll combination is simple: pick two from a list of rolls for about $7. That's a pretty good deal since just the rolls are usually more than that and you also get the soup and salad.  This is where things start to fall apart. While I do appreciate getting 8 pieces rather than 6 for each roll (I was expecting skimpy rolls for a lunch special and was pleasantly surprised) the rice itself was mushy. If I was making the sushi I would never have served that rice. One of the rolls I ordered was the Philadelphia roll, a personal favorite. Usually that means smoked salmon and Philadelphia cream cheese as if it were a bagel. Instead of salmon they used tuna. A weird choice and ok tasting, but I was expecting salmon like every other Philly roll I've ever had uses.

Overall it's cheap sushi but you don't get nearly the quality you do at other places. I've even seen buffets that are better.",2,"bad"
