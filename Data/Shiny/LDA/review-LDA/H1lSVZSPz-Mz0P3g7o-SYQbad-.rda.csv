"2","4.5 STARS! This relatively new sushi bar & Japanese grill is a WONDERFUL addition to the Lutz area. Its interior is clean, fresh, & modern. The reclaimed natural redwood from the San Francisco Bay area is GORGEOUS! 

There's a beverage bar (yes, alcohol), a sushi bar, tables & chairs separated by plexiglass, three larger more secluded padded booths, & many tables taking center stage on the dining room floor. Service was fast & friendly; Adeline C. was especially good. The thick wooden menus are sanitized after each use & sealed. 

According to the menu, ""Zukka-San represents an elevated experience & expanded menu from the first Zukku-San started from a humble 350 sq foot stall inside Tampa's Amateur Works Food Hall. The towering wood patterns of ""Koi"" fish swimming against a sea of waves were meticulously designed & carved by a local artist."" L00K UP to see all the Koi! Truly an aestetically-pleasing restaurant!

The menu offers 16 ""Starters,"" including Crab Rangoon, three types of Yakitori, Ahi Tuna Tartar, Dumplings, & Baked Mussels. (Our Steak Yakitori was EXCELLENT. Our Shrimp Yakitori was EVEN BETTER-- see pic!)

There are 17 ""Masterpiece Sushi Rolls"" available. Our Sunset Roll @ $12.95 w/ real crab, Ahi tuna, cucumber, avocado, & cilantro (etc.) was EXCELLENT. The waitress stated that the Dancing Dragon @ $13.95 is a patron favorite. It includes Spicy Ahu tuna, tempura shrimp, tuna, scallions, spicy mayo, & eel sauce, etc. (We returned for it two days later; it was VERY GOOD!)

Seventeen (17) ""Nigiri & Sashimi"" offerings range from $4.50 to $6.95. Nigiri consists of two pieces-- Sashimi three. Twelve (12) ""Classic Rolls"" & ten (10) ""Hand Rolls"" are available; they range in price from $5.95 to $7.95.

The six desserts sound DELICIOUS: Triple Chocolate Cake, Triple Layer Carrot Cake, Matcha Green Tea Cheesecake, Fried New York Style Cheesecake, Vanilla Bean Shortbread Ice Cream, & Carrot Cake Fried Ice Cream.

Am looking forward to returning soon-- repeatedly returning-- lol! Definitely a very good sushi & grill restaurant. Lots of parking available, as well as Curbside (see pic), Delivery, & Take Out.",1,"good"
"3","So excited to have this sushi restaurant in the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area. Located across from the Tampa outlets. The restaurant itself is new and very clean with wonderful decor, high ceilings, a sushi bar and regular bar with one television. Exceptional service. The food is fantastic and fresh. So delicious. We started with the Grilled Hamachi Collar: bone in hamachi collar grilled to perfection and served with Ponzu sauce. For our meal we had the Florida roll: salmon, tuna, cream cheese, avocado, masago and sesame seeds. Dancing dragon roll: spicy ahi tuna, tempura shrimp and cucumber, topped with tuna, sweet eel sauce, spicy Mayo, sesame seeds, masago and scallions and the Zukku roll: tempura shrimp, cucumber, crab mix, salmon, lemon slices, masago, scallion, spicy mayo, sweet eel sauce. They were all wonderful, my favorite was the Zukku roll. Beautiful presentation. For dessert the server would not let us leave without trying the carrot cake fried ice cream, and we are so glad she did. Vanilla shortbread ice cream surrounded by carrot cake flash tempura  fried. Absolutely one of the most delicious non chocolate desserts I've ever had. Not too sweet, just perfect. Will definitely be back!!!",2,"good"
"4","Overall disappointed.  Went with a group of friends and waited 30 minutes to get served our first drinks.  Drinks were served incorrectly and we were informed the bar was out of most of the drinks we tried to order.  Food was okay, but overpriced.  Probably wouldn't go again. 

Tip to management : don't advertise aesthetic drinks like the lychee martini and then don't include the edible flower when serving to guests .

We all ordered the drinks because they were cute online and got served without the flower or aesthetic. It was a sad looking drink ...

"5","Worst sushi experience ever.
I was so excited because of all the reviews I had read prior to eating there. But my goodness, I was served the FISHIEST scallops I've ever had. So fishy that my friend could smell from across the table. Another friend of mine felt sick after having a scallop hand roll. His was also unbearably fishy. 
And don't get me started on their Ahi Tuna Tartar.. hard avocado that the cook basically couldn't cut through but decided to still serve it to us. They couldn't cut through some that the unripe avocados were still attached to each other with ""cuts"" that were supposed to separate them. Might I add, that once we told our waitress, she proceeded to tell us she'd take ""50% off the appetizer"" I was shocked. 
Lastly, the portions.. smallest Masterpiece Sushi Rolls I've ever had. The kick is, it didn't even taste good. Probably could get better or equivalent at a Buffet.  
Simply a waste of money. Great drinks though, but unfortunately, that's about it. 
I went with four friends and we were all so disappointed. 
Don't go if you're looking to eat sushi.",2,"bad"
