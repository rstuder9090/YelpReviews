"2","I am a spent ronin, balding, emaciated, with the fire in me about to extingush. I am one without a master. 

Or a slave. 

In my days, I was the wind and fire. I was the air that people couldn't see. I was the fear in the stomachs of the rabble when I whooshed through the streets, my review-katana in the air, chasing unspeakable eateries, and slaughtering worthless restaurants.

That was then.

This is now. I am old. Aye! I've sired a few ruts here and there, and they don't even write me, but I have no one except my stomach to care for me. It was a cold January evening when I saw the signs for Samurai Sushi. At this point I had gone a full 6 hours without any food, and a full 6 months without any sushi, and a good 33 years without any meat in me.

I was famished. My stomach growled. I growled back at it.

I entered the inn, and a kind old lady stared at me for a second longer than needed. My hand reached for my sword. She bowed and welcomed us in (some peeps came along). She presented me a papyrus with the days' fares. I scanned it for something that didn't have any meat. There were precisely 4: the tamago, the edmame, the miso soup and the vegetarian roll. 

Out of about thirty different rolls, I was given a choice of precisely one. My eyes narrowed, and my head went down. I pulled my sword half out, when the kind lady came with glasses of sake. She saw my dilemma, and quickly said that she could change any roll to anything that'd suit my desires. I changed the seafood roll without the squid, fish or roe, and instead added asparagus and Japanese cucumber. Best goddang roll ever, especially with wasabi.

The tamago reminded me of my mother's eggs, which is funny because my mom is a strict vegan, and never fed me any eggs. But so good were they that deep inside me a string loosened, and I broke down into my sushi plate into a bucket of tears. The chef came out, and said, ""There! There!"" and gave me a hard candy.

I'd go back there in a heartbeat.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I moved to Nashville a year ago, and we have had so many amazing dining experiences, I have decided to start leaving reviews to show some love to our favorite places. 
Well Samurai is definitely in our top faves! 
We are BIG TIME sushi lovers. Honestly, we could eat sushi everyday and never get tired of it. So needless to say, we have been to a ridiculous amount of sushi restaurants all over the country, and this little gem really is one of our faves ever!
It reminds us of our favorite hole in the wall sushi spots in NYC! 

If you are going to Samurai for a fancy ambiance, just don't. If you are looking for awesome sushi & generous portions for great prices, you will NOT be disappointed!

I would say they have the best prices for value that I have seen in Nashville.
My husband and I are BIG nigiri people, and my biggest pet peeve is when the nigiri fish portions are stingy. Skimpy piece of fish on top of a gigantic ball of rice? No thank you. And this is NOT the case at Samurai. The nigiri & sashimi portions are thick and wonderful! You cannot beat it, ESPECIALLY for the price. 

I am a creature of habit, and I usually get the same thing each time: Miso soup, a house salad with ginger dressing, several salmon nigiri (the salmon just MELTS in your mouth.) and a spicy tuna roll. 
Now, I am picky about my spicy tuna rolls. I do not like spicy tuna rolls that are spiced by using spicy mayo or a spice rub on the outside. I prefer a spicy tuna that is minced & has the spiciness mixed in. I'm sure this isn't everyone's preference, but it is definitely mine, and Samurai does this better than any other sushi place in Nashville. 

My absolute FAVORITE roll (and it is exclusive to Samurai) is the Ninza roll. It is a spicy tuna roll, covered on the outside with tuna, salmon, whitefish, avocado & spicy mayo. DE.LISH. If you like spicy tuna, you gotta try it.
My husband loves the Music City roll, spicy yellowtail, several of the more obscure rolls, as well as almost all of the nigiri options (Salmon & seabass being his faves).

I realize I've rambled on, but we really do love this place. Everyone there is very kind. They know us by name because of how often we either dine in or order take-out. We have never had a bad experience, the sushi is fresh, the sushi chef's are highly skilled & wonderful at what they do. If you are looking for wonderful sushi at a wonderful price, and you love a good hole in the wall gem (and honestly, even if you don't), you have to try Samurai. It's just a must in my book.",2,"good"
