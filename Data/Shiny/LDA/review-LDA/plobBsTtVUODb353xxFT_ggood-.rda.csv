"2","I really, REALLY like this place. I have been here a number of times over the last two years thanks to my friend, and fellow AYCE sushi warror Kristina. This place is never SUPER busy(although I do come on off times), which is nice. The bar is a bit small but I never sit at the bar at this place because I prefer to do some serious damage at a table where they can bring out trays and trays of sushi for me. The area is light and comfortable, and I can actually see my food unlike some other weird, dark sushi places. 

Service is pretty good, though admittedly, they do mix up my orders sometimes. I ordered one order of mussels last time and somehow ended up with four. I`m not really complaining, but it was just random and odd. On other occasions I`ve gotten rolls that were meant for other tables which is again not a huge deal. I`m very non picky and forgiving in terms of mistakes. I think it adds to the charm and overall experience. The servers are always really nice, attentive, and willing to accomodate your requests. The price for this AYCE sushi establishment is on par, if not a little bit lower than others in the area. Lunch is a great deal with AYCE appetizers, a good selection of rolls, nirgiri, and dessert. I`ve never been here for dinner but I`m sure it is just as good. You get free sushi on your birthday, and they have a VIP card. Take note. 

As far as the quality and taste of the sushi I have to say I really enjoy Sushi Rose. I think their nirigi is put together well with not too much rice and a nice sized slab of fish on top. It tastes fresh, and the texture is buttery and definitely a turn on. :) They have some pretty standard rolls here that you are likely to see around the Reno AYCE Sushi scene. Golden Gate, Reno, Spicy Tuna, Mountain, etc. I think the rolls are executed well with an abundance of fish and filling added. The rolls topped with crab are overflowing with delicious shredded crab. The quail egg shooters are yummy! The appetizers are really awesome. I usually get the tempura vegetables, seaweed salad, miso soup, mussels, and crab rangoon. All really yummy. I like the texture of the mussels ALOT(which is why I didn`t mind the four orders). All in all I really like this place. Small, cute, good service, good sushi. Go!",1,"good"
"3","Still one of my favorite sushi spots. Mariner is amazing cooked roll along with crazy hand roll. The sizes are so perfect to not get full on one long roll. 

There are mainly 3 servers it seems, two males, the blonde one being newer than the dark haired one, Riley. The woman is efficient and wants to provide you with good service but she can leave fast and doesn't always smile, but she isn't rude. 

I think the chef Chao is gone, haven't seen him last 3 times I've been in, which have been different days. The lady chef is still there along with a young white male and another couple Asian makes. I haven't sat at the bar in a long time so I have no idea who is making what, but I've been pretty happy with everything the last 10 or so visits. 

Today on Mother's Day they were slammed and short staffed a bit. The chefs accidentally made us our 5 long rolls order twice (they must have forgot to mark off they were already made, or make that a policy lol) but when we brought it up the Asian woman server, she misunderstood us thinking we were complaining about wait time when really we weren't prepared for another 3 long rolls that was a double order. Riley ended up taking our plate away without hesitation after we brought up our issue with him and he understood our concern about not being able to finish those extra rolls. I didn't watch what he did with te plate, but I sure hope they sneak in the back and get to eat the mistakes cause I felt terrible for the waste, but it wasn't our fault. Next someone who was helping the chefs, I think he's from the wok side, brought us over 2 more rolls (the chaos) we had already had and we had to say again, we already got them. He came back with the ticket and we cleared up that that the chefs made the orders twice, again no issues. 

I still love the mussels, some say overdone but I love them crunchy and drier, also never had a beard left on here which ruins me for mussels for months. Skeeves me out when they aren't cleaned right. 

The miso is some of the best in town too. One time a guy came in with a big thermos and asked for that and a big styrofoam container to go haha

This time I also had some of their appetizer tempera calamari which is now added on to my regular stuff to order. Served with just teriyaki sauce I loved the flavor. Not rubbery and not heavily fried. 

Edamame is solid as well as the seaweed salad which is just sold/bought in a premade container anyways. 

The quail egg shooters are good too, made with soy which I like. 

Size and rice to fish ratio is the same and perfect for AYCE. The rice is still some of the best flavored in town IMO. 

I'd say the biggest downfall might be chef creativity as far as different things not on the menu, and no Wayne's rolls here. Which reminds me the cooked scallop mixture is not good here, very bland and you can tell its mayo mixed in. The scallop nigiri (hotate? Something like this) is amazing here with the delicious ponzu sauce, too bad I can't get them anymore.",2,"good"
