"2","Sakana is a specialty sushi place and the specialty sushi is excellent.  It is not a place for traditional or perhaps ""authentic"" sushi, but if you like sushi and like a little creativity with your rolls, this place is for you. 

Not only is the fish quality great, but the combinations they offer for specialty sushi are very inspired. Most prominent on the menu are the ""press box"" items. It was explained to me that the ""press box"" items are essentially rolls constructed with a technique that keeps the ingredients together without the seaweed. To me, I understood this to be an accommodation to a population who doesn't prefer seaweed. It could also be that seaweed might prevent some of their flash frying and ""torching"" (applying the fire from a hand torch), which were common methods of preparation on many of the menu items. 

That was another aspect of the menu that intrigued me--that many of the rolls and items were either flash fried, seared, or torched. I haven't been to a sushi place where so many of the items strayed away from strict presentation of fresh raw fish. This isn't to say that they weren't using fresh fish or anything of the sort (it all tasted amazing to me), but perhaps it does reflect how Sakana seeks to be different. Perhaps it has in mind to accommodate a less tolerant American palate. Whatever the case, the torching was a fun sight to see, adding some entertainment for those of seated at the bar, where they showcase the torching of the tops of nearly complete rolls above the dividing wall.

We ordered the habanero yellowtail melt press box, the half and half (salmon & tuna), and the garlic albacore. We also ordered the seared wagyu beef wrapped around enoki mushrooms for an appetizer. 

The habenero yellowtail melt press box was incredible. It was undoubtedly the highlight of a fantastic meal for me. The roll comes with a variety of sauces on the plate for you to dip and enjoy, as well as traditional mainstays pickled ginger and wasabi. The dipping sauces were interesting, but the cut pieces were incredible by themselves. Every bite was a tantalizing experience, and when we had eaten all of the roll, the disappointment of a finished meal set in. We didn't want it to end! We wished we had ordered more specialty sushi press boxes. 

The garlic albacore was very smooth and buttery as well. My wife enjoyed it a little more than I, but it was still delicious. Because they have a large menu of really interesting specialty sushi, I don't know if I would order it again. Same goes for the half and half (salmon and tuna). Although delicious and a little more typical of a sushi experience, I would like to explore more of the specialty sushi on a return visit.

Another highlight of the meal was the appetizer--the seared wagyu wrapped around enoki mushrooms. The beef was incredibly tender and flavorful. Having never had wagyu (or kobe), I had high expectations that were unmistakably met. It was a wonderful introduction to our meal and to a highly satisfying experience.

Sakana is a wonderful sushi restaurant with wonderfully inspired sushi and presentation. It was well worth the visit.",1,"good"
"3","""Hands down the best sushi I have ever eaten: I dream of it at night,"" reads the last review by Sierra R. I could not say it better but will add a bit about the decor which others seem not to mention as noteworthy but certainly is. 

I have been eating sushi in SB for many years. This is fine dining sushi but depending upon what you order, just about 25% more than Kyoto, which is my favorite (happy hour Mon through Thurs 5 to 6, the best salad dressing of any Japanese restaurant anywhere in the country I've eaten, terrific sukiyaki and cooked meat as well as sushi). 

Yes, there are some very fancy appetizers and rolls but mine--the T and T (crab meat, spicy tuna, avocado with tuna and jalapeno and a dazzling array of sauces with equally dazzling presentation on the plate) was 14.50. I ordered two pieces of Ikura, salmon roe eggs which a friend calls ""balls of fishy heaven"" and with a large sake, it was 34 pre-tip

Yes, that's more than Kyoto (though NOT more than Arigato) but HERE is what Sakana has over that trendy, wannabe Nobu or Matsuhisa: a great Montecito, grown-up affluent crowd versus a younger, trendy, annoying wannabe affluent crowd downtown. I went to the old Arigato in Victoria Court years ago and yes, it was excellent and I enjoyed my meals

The new one is just wannabe hipster and people go there to prove they're cool which I can't bear. 

This is not a senior citizen Montecito 1%-2% crowd: it's the 45 to 55 set. The two women next to me at the sushi bar (high stools, extremely comfortable) were both moms having a mom dinner out without husbands or kids. They were the kind of women I love running into when I'm in NY and LA but never happen upon in SB because unless you have kids at Laguna Blanca, or perhaps Cate, you just don't meet this kind of female professional in that age range. 

The place is indeed small but it's NOT loud and there is no annoying Japanese rock to content with as at Shintori (whose fish has recently gone up a few notches and whose 10 dollar lunch is a regular event for me) or benign banal Japanese ballads (as at Kyoto). 

It's sleek, modern and white with an indigo hue and the servers are all very pretty, young (and oddly, Caucasian). I am in love with Sakana and while it's more a ""special occasion"" sushi (I didn't try the press boxes but saw countless dishes coming from the sushi bar where I saw, each one more scrumptious looking than the last), it's worth the money. 

Phenomenal food, adorable decor, good service, nice ambiance and a laid back affluent crowd 45 to 55 who live in Montecito. What more can one ask for? 

One pretty mom--really skinny, great jewelry--was waiting for her daughter, a tall skinny girl who looked just like her minus the bling, who came in exhausted from some sort of sports practice ready for dinner around 7PM. They reminded me of me and my mother except of course the jewelry as my beloved and esteemed mother is what I call ""pathologically frugal"" and only wears costume jewelry unless it was my Grandma's from the safe deposit box (or her wedding ring Dad designed in 1966). 

Mom and I started going to sushi bars--Hakata--casual but good old place 25 yrs old on Wilshire Blvd in Santa Monica when I was 7. This was definitely a mom with only one child: mothers with only one child (a daughter) are either very close or they don't get on at all and as someone who was called my mother's ""little best friend"" from 4 on, I can always spot a special mommy and daughter team

It's more than phenomenal food: you can actually feel wheels turning in smart, interesting people who travel a lot out of SB and have very pleasant lives. 

LOVE

P.S. I never knew anyone who came here and heard some awful things about how overpriced it was and how mediocre the fish. Not at all true. BUT the menu is overwhelming and it's best to ask your server what you should eat based on the preferences you express to her. Sitting at the sushi bar the first or second time is a good idea because you can ask your server what others are having among the dishes which catch your eye",2,"good"
"4","We had very high hopes for this restaurant based on all the reviews we read on yelp and google. What we actually should have paid attention to was the few negative reviews. Sakana feels like they are pricing their menu in a way that solely capitalizes on the extremely pricey area of Montecito they are located in, not the quality of food they are serving.

The first problem was when we ordered the sake. They have 2 prices, for large or small. Common sense would make you believe you're actually ordering a large or small actual bottle of sake. Generally that's 300 ml or 720 ml bottles. However, this restaurant takes a large bottle and pours it into their little carafes and CALLS it a large bottle. Very deceptive and disappointing and the tiny carafe of sake we got which was smaller than a 12 ounce bottle of beer was NOT worth $24. After asking the server she said their small bottle would get you about 3 shots. I'm guessing that's if you're lucky, based on the size of the ""large"" bottle they served. 

We ordered the garlic edamame without checking the price and that was my bad, because if I had seen it was $9 we would have passed. The edamame portion was small, and some were warm, most were cold. Not consistent and nothing special. 

The specialty roll (lobster melt) for $20 was 5 pieces, and signature press box (habanero yellowtail melt) for $19.5 was also pretty small. Both were pretty tasty I'll give them that - but the portions were severely lacking. We ordered a regular salmon roll to try to get a little more filled up but really wish we didn't because it was terrible. Think very sub par to grocery store sushi. It felt like that roll was just an afterthought slapped together.

I have to say, maybe we are spoiled with excellent sushi where we live in San Diego and so the reviews for this place are based on just not having any good sushi options in the area, but for a $120+ dinner that whole meal was really worth half the price if being generous.",1,"bad"
"5","Beware- the Yelp reviews are very misleading.  I would avoid this place and go elsewhere.

Geez, where to begin?  Let's start by saying, this is the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different sushi at various price points.  The sushi at Whole Foods is actually better, so that should tell you something.   The prices are some of the highest I've seen, yet the quality is incredibly low.  So why are there so many glowing Yelp reviews??  Something doesn't add up....

First of all, the menu is quite extensive, but not in a good way.  The dizzying array of options was overwhelming, and it took my boyfriend and I forever to decide.  Second, we were surprised by how high the prices were, but we assumed it meant that the fish would be outstanding.  They were a lot higher than usual, even for a high-end restaurant.  Third, the flavor combinations seemed a little too eclectic, which caused me to wonder if this place was trying too hard.

My boyfriend and I started with the following nigiri: yellowtail, salmon, king salmon, aburi (fatty) salmon, albacore, bluefin tuna and eel.  We also ordered ponzu sauce on the side.  The nigiri was absolutely bland and completely lackluster.  The fish was chewy and did not melt in my mouth.  The sushi rice was awful- dense, flavorless and too thick, which defeats the purpose of having nigiri.  It was like eating a rice patty with a strip of fish.  Oddly enough, as dense as the rice was, it fell apart and did not hold together like it should.  It also had a strange brown color, which suggests that they used balsamic vinegar, instead of rice vinegar.  The eel was coated in a red wine sauce which was overly acidic and overwhelmed the fish.  Even the ponzu was terrible, tasting purely of balsamic vinegar and lacking a lovely citrus taste.  Complete fail.

Next, we had the following rolls: crispy spicy tuna, toro and herbed yellowtail.  These rolls definitely tasted better than the nigiri, but only because they were drowning in a bunch of different sauces.  We couldn't really taste the fish at all.  I will say that the presentation was nice and pleasing to look at, but it was very clear that they were trying to cover up the flavorless fish and bland rice with spicy mayo and soy sauce.

The final item we ordered was the Chilean sea bass misozuke, which is under their hot appetizers.  The quality of the sea bass was good, and the texture was quite tender and luscious, as you would expect from sea bass.  However, the sauce lacked complexity and tasted too sweet.  Also, there were bones in my fish.  Considering this tiny appetizer costs almost $20, the least they could do was remove the bones.

The only reason why this place even deserves one star, is because the service is very good.  My boyfriend and I came in shortly after they opened on a Saturday evening, and a friendly hostess seated us immediately.  Our server (Ana) was very sweet and went above and beyond.  The busboy constantly refilled our water glasses.  The food came out quickly.  

All in all, such a disappointing experience and a complete waste of money.  Our bill came to over $200 after tip, so we feel especially angry at the fact that we dumped a significant amount on poor quality seafood.  If you don't know what delicious, authentic sushi should taste like, and you enjoy being overcharged for what can only be described as ""white people sushi,"" as it's drowned in heavy, salty sauces, then this place is for you.  The owners are trying way too hard to be unique and eclectic, and they're so determined to dazzle the customer with their ridiculous flavor combinations, that they forgot the two most important aspects of a sushi restaurant: high-quality, flavorful fish and perfectly balanced sushi rice.  Such a shame!!",2,"bad"
