Kaisen, like 4 rivers, is surprisingly closer than I thought. It is in a strip mall with Michael's goods and a Nutrition s'mart just south of the Bearss/Dale Mabry intersection.

The decor is somewhat understated. It is clean and has a intimate feeling (on a weekday evening).I had 2 servers rotating but they were nice and prompt with food/drinks etc. Bonus points to the one who presented the omakase;she rattled off the entire list and description without error.
 You can tell it there are many regulars b/c one of the chefs is very gregarious, talking to the customers like long time friends.

I've been to sushi places in Tampa,St Maarten, Detroit, and Chicago. I fall straight in the middle of being the sushi experience graph.
I tend to be somewhat conservative and get 3 maki rolls, with 2 special and one simple.

However, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try the Omakase (chefs choice)at the 35 dollar level (I generally spend about 30 US give or take at sushi restaurants). 

I had 2 plates for the Omakase. The first was a mixture of cups filled with roe/other fish, sashimi, and nigiri. Usually Im pretty meticulous at remembering what I ate. The server told me everything in great deal but I couldnt remember it lol.
I posted a picture if you want to try and ID it . I liked the ""cups"" the best, very flavorful especially the roe and the 2nd/3rd cups from the left side.
The sashimi was the second best they were very melty in your mouth and yummy.
The nigiri was solid, but loses to the other two.

The second plate of omakase was an eel roll. This had a nice sauce (perhaps Ponzu?) and very flavorful.

I was still hungry , so I ordered the Okonimiyaki on a whim. Man this thing is huge!
I was expecting a dinky IHOP pancake. While seafood and pancake screams GI dysfunction, I found it an excellent combo. It was served piping hot and I inhaled the little that I could finish  
Note: It takes about 22-23 minutes minimum and is $11 but its worth it.

There are 2 schools of thought wiith sushi. Some prefer American style sushi with many sauces and lots of combinations of fish, and some some prefer a more Japanese style with minimal sauce and just 1-2 fish.
I cant say which is better;I like some of both.
The fish quality is very good all around. The omakase and okonimiyaki are new experiences for me. 

Kaisen is better than many Tampa restaurants, but not the absolute best I've ever had.

That honor goes to Toro Sushi in Chicago. (See my review. Blatant plug)

The prices were very fair regarding the rolls. IIRC, the most expensive roll is about 12, whereas other Tampa specialty roll tend to go into the 15-16 range.

I would come back to Kaisen though in the future. You should too.",1,"good"
"3","I've had lots of mediocre sushi in Tampa. From SB in Ybor City to CB near the stadium, there's a lot of just average... or restaurants trying too hard to be fusion.  I grew up near Tampa, and every time I come back, there's only one requirement as far as dining -- I have to get in to see Ryo at Kaisen Sushi.

Kaisen is a little known secret that Tampa has been hiding for years.  Ryo initially opened over by Harpos, further south on Dale Mabry than their current location.  I went in for the first time in 1999, and have been a repeat customer ever since, dining there sometimes twice a week.  In all my years of eating at Kaisen, I've never once been disappointed.  In fact, they know me by name now and I get that personal of service that keeps me coming back.

Here are my highlights:

Appetizer:
Calamari -- I can't say enough about this stuff.  It's not your typical frozen rings, this stuff is FRESH.  They saute large chunks octopus, not just rings or tentacles, in a delicious sauce that has a mild tangy flavor to it.  It's then topped with bonito flake, green onion, and a lemon.  I could eat calamari appetizers as a meal and walk away satisfied... 

Stuffed Mushrooms -- Forget everything you know about stuffed mushrooms.  Ryo takes large mushrooms, stuffs them with crab meat, tempura batters, and deep fries them.  They're then coated with what I think is ponzu sauce for a delicious creation. 

Nigiri:

One of my personal favorites is the zuke tuna.  Ryo takes the best cuts of Tuna and marinates them in what I believe to be sesame oil, rice vinegar, and soy sauce, for about three days.  The fish changes consistency and flavor, and becomes just ridiculously good.  You have to try it.

Ryo's fish selection and cuts are the absolute best in Tampa, in my opinion.  He hand-selects everything, and he's committed to culinary excellence.  You really can't go wrong.

Rolls:

My personal favorite, although not containing raw fish, is the Cynthia's Vegetable Tempura roll.  The kitchen takes asparagus and sweet potatoes, tempura batters, then deep fries them.  These scrumptious veggies are then rolled up and served with a side of ponzu sauce.  It's HEAVENLY. 

The spicy tuna is by far the best I've ever had as well.  Most restaurants pulverize the tuna or use shoddier quality of fish.  Ryo takes his sushi tuna, cubes it, and mixes it with spicy sauce.  You don't feel like you're eating some strange mush -- it has consistency, texture, and above all, great flavor.

Dessert:

I love the green tea ice cream.  It's that simple.  They also carry ""Red Bean"" ice cream, but I tend to stay away from that.  It's a little too weird for me. 

For all you non-sushi lovers, they do a delicious cooked salmon and chicken teriyaki.  

I can't recommend Kaisen Sushi enough, that's plain and simple.  If you're a first time sushi-er, or a seasoned expert, stop into Kaisen and prepare to be wowed.  They also organize a yearly fishing trip, and I hear a lot of people have had a really good time on these excursions.  You'll always see Ryo making sushi, and his Dad and sometimes his wife are there working to keep the place running smoothly.  

GO! NOW (unless it's Sunday or Monday)!  DO IT! :-)",2,"good"
