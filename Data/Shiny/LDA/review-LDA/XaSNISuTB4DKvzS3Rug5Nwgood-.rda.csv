Looks real nice inside, good job.. however it was an odd choice to go with red and white checkered table cloth like the stereotypical Italian-American cliche.

Service was good, (was a Tue eve at 6)  5 other tables eating

We had the Tom Yum Goong Thai soup: 
Very good, I suspect a tad above many folks preferred heat/spice limit. I liked it. Good blend of flavor, not overly acidic as so many can be. Only negative comment is if you list ""prawns"" as an ingredient, dont use the some of the smallest shrimp available. Prawns imply big shrimp (in this country)

Won Ton soup was very nicely done. Basic

Pork Goyza (fried dumpling):
 was also good. These seemed to be steamed first then lightly fried.

Green salad with ginger dressing
Very basic, but good

The SO Special Duck:
 (crispy duck,jumbo shrimp, chicken,pork ,beef, Peking sauce)
I'm a fan! Great flavor. Duck a little fatty (as often is the case) Jumbo Shrimp were medium large, but tasty. Very balanced.

Sweet and sour chicken:
Good, very basic (sorry to me this is the chicken mc'nuggets of the asian world)

We will return to try more of the Thai and Japanese offerings

FYI: They do not offer the combo dinners listed on take out for dining in",1,"good"
"3","On my first visit here today, I was super impressed with everything there, and can't wait to return. Piping hot, fresh, delicious food: as a lunch special, I got soup, entr√©e and rice for $6.95, and it was unexpectedly awesome. I began with hot green tea , then egg drop soup that was the perfect size, nice and hot, fresh crisp scallions on good soup. Then I had the best sweet & sour chicken I've ever tasted. Straight from the fryer (that was obviously using clean oil), crispy, with a tasty and steaming-hot (if lurid red) dipping sauce *on the side* (this is key), and a generous helping of pork fried rice.

That's the way to do it. DIP the crispy, light, pillowy, perfectly cooked chicken pieces into the sauce, so they stay crispy the whole time. I also put some crispy chicken into my soup spoon, to scoop the last of the soup into the same bite with it. 

My table, the whole place, including the restroom, were spotlessly clean with pleasant decor. I liked the tied-aside beaded curtains to the restroom area. 

I also liked the server (owner, too?) -- friendly with everyone who came in, and on point in every way, cool, quick, and made it look effortless. I told him how great the food was and how I liked that it was served so hot. Really good food made and served with attention to quality. Can't wait to try everything on the menu, starting with the fried oysters. Or maybe the asparagus with beef. Or any of the Japanese or Thai menus...

Maybe this review was long, but I'm in this area a few times a month, and I can see myself becoming a regular at this place. It's crave-worthy.",2,"good"
