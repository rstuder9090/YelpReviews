"2","I started a sushi club with friends 2 years ago that we try one BYOB sushi restaurant in the area one Thursday a month. This was to be the last one I organize. Our club has grown so we generally have 15-20 people.  We originally picked Kumo at Collegeville where we had 23 people doing family style and was floored by the sushi but they don't take big group Thursday-Sunday now. I made reservation for 16 on Tuesday at Ooka for 7:30 on a Friday and was told they could only do 8:30 with a group our size. I called on Thursday to add 2 more people and was told they can't guarantee we would be seated by 8:30 and that 9:00 would be better because it's a Friday. By then I was getting apprehended that this would be quite a hassle with long waits and delays.

We were very pleasantly surprised!!! Not only were we promptly seated at 8:30, the service was so exceptional and speedy. Based on our experience with other sushi places, we ordered edamame thinking it would hold us over till sushi comes. And food came out so fast edamame was left uneaten!

My new favorite Roll that I didn't try previous time was Shrimp and Baked Sea Scallops Roll. It is dynamite! Our favs from previous were AAA Roll and James Bond. Hubby likes Lobster Dynamite Roll too! I didn't care for the Spicy Scallop Tempura Roll last time and even less so this time. It depends on which piece you happen to eat. The pieces that have more avocado and less eels taste better. Eels could be pretty overpowering. We tried other rolls from someone else's plates. These were all good but not necessarily as memorable: Hot Spicy Roll, Purple Roll, Ooka Roll. 

A few of us also opted for hibachi. It was very entertaining! 

Now up to my favorite thing of this restaurant, Desserts!!! They have hands down the best desserts of all sushi restaurants we tried. I don't normally care for sweets but I had two desserts both times I was there. I had my fav from last time the Ruby Poached Japanese Pear and a new one Garden in a Glass, yummy mixture of Panna Cotta and strawberry pur√©e with Chocolate 'dirt'. Heavenly!

I was very happy this was where we had our final sushi club dinner! Great food and great service!!!",1,"good"
"3","A FABULOUS night out at Ookas.  Service (Ann) was spectacular, our meals both picturesque platings and so incredibly fresh and what awesome textures and the flavor far exceeded expectations.

Doesn't get better than at Ookas, you just have to know what you like and how to order; rely on your server for assistance as that is one of the key reasons they are there.

After discussing the night's specials and reviewing the menu we spoke with Ann to get her take on how we wanted to structure our meal. For this visit we opted to stick with appetizers and rolls which we shared; hence no entree.  In the end, it was a perfect selection, ordering, and experience.

Now to get your mouth watering.... for our first course, we started with the tuna bites ---  roasted pistachio, spicy tuna bite with mango salsa.  Definitely something different and boy the plating presentation was spectacular. What a great flavor coaster.... you taste the crushed pistachios, followed by the tuna and on the back end you get a little kick from the mango salsa.  Satisfying to the palette. 

For our second course, my wife had the lobster bun- Boston fresh Maine lobster with house cream sauce served in a split bun and wrapped in Boston lettuce all served in a martini glass.  Very pretty presentation and tasty too. 

I had the grilled octopus and I must say, this was one of the top 2 octopus dishes I've ever had and I seek it out high and low; hands down this recipe delivers a wonderful combination of flavors.  Grilled octopus tentacles served over a bed of salad greens with halved cherry tomatoes in a pomegranate reduction that was to die for. 

For our third course, we shared the Earth/Sea Roll- a special roll, (couldn't find on their online menus so I'll do my best to describe) outside is perfectly cooked filet mignon wrapped around the rice exterior of the roll which was filled with mango, cucumber, topped with roe, (I'm embarrassed that I can't recall the fish in the roll) with white truffle sprinkled on the plate.  This roll delivers a festival of flavors and textures.

Can't say excellent experience enough times.",2,"good"
"4","The service at this place was terrible! I don't know why we even went here because we swore off chain restaurants. Never again, NEVER! If I want Japanese food I'll go down the street to Umami Umami where they do not ignore their customers!

Stood there waiting for a full minute and a half until the hostess turned to us and acknowledge us.

While waiting to be acknowledge the hostess turned to a female who I assume was a waitress and asked her, ""Do you want them?"" To which the female replied, ""No, give them to [so-and-so]"" How rude! We're standing right there! The girls were talking about us like we were inanimate objects!

We were seated at a table immediately as soon as customers walk in - no privacy whatsoever.

The hostess gave us menus, and then the waitress (Jessica?) took our drink order, brought our waters and absolutely ignored us for no less than eight minutes. Eight minutes!

At this point I would have walked out if my companion was not looking so forward to coming here.

We did not feel welcomed at all. We had questions about things on the menu, it was our first time in the restaurant but there was nobody to ask these questions to. Nobody cared. Other people were asking questions of their waitress, but nobody bothered to ask if we had any questions about anything.

We ordered after waiting eight minutes. The soup and ""salad"" were brought to us. I said ""thank you"" and was totally ignored. The person who dropped off the food never acknowledged my ""thank you.""

When somebody came by to clear the dirty dishes, my companion was told to keep his fork. Here we go again! What is with waitresses and the keeping of the fork? GET HIM A CLEAN FORK! You should have supplied a salad fork when you brought the salad! How dare you tell the customer what to do! Learn this: The customer is paying you, NOT the other way around!

The food was the only saving grace of this place. It was very tasty for not having any idea what I was ordering I did pretty well.

I had to stop a girl who was filling water glasses for another table and ask her for water for us. Why? Why do I need to ask for water?!

And nobody bothered to check on us and ask us how our meal was, nobody! Again, totally ignored!

After we ate all we could, a female came by and picked up the plates and brought back containers, not a bag with the containers, just the containers.

She begrudgingly asked, ""Do you want dessert?"" I said, ""Do you have a dessert menu?"" How do we know if we want dessert if you don't show us a menu? She was so rude! We were obviously bothering her.

After looking at the menu, we decided no dessert. I wanted to get out of there ASAP. The bill was put on our table, I put the credit card on there, put a tip and immediately after shutting the folder, a hand was out practically ripping the bill out of my hand.

She wasn't around while we were eating or wanting more water or had questions to ask or give us a quiet place to sit, but she had no problem being ""on me"" while I was taking care of the bill!

We will NOT be going back to these ignorant people, but look forward to trying one of the other locations.

I obviously missed the disclaimer that this place is self-service. The sauce was not included with the rest of my meal in the takeaway container. Can't say ""doggie bag"" since we weren't given a BAG! Why didn't they include the sauce? Is leftover sauce mixed back into a ""community pot"" and given to the next customer?",1,"bad"
"5","Went here for dinner this weekend. Atmosphere is nice and great for dates or family outings. Reservations are recommended as it gets quite busy! 

I did notice that there were many hostesses/waitresses clumped behind the front desk standing and talking to each other, however none seemed eager to seat us. Had to wait for a few minutes until their conversation was over to be seated.

After being seated, we ordered the tuna tartar appetizer which describes it topped with a quail egg. When it came out we noticed there was no egg and asked the waitress about it. She returned after talking to the chef saying they ran out but added a larger portion of tuna to compensate. We were a bit upset at not being told this before the food came out and asked if it was ok, especially since it was an $18 appetizer. Even with the ""extra portion"" of tuna (which by the way may or may not have happened as the portion is still incredibly tiny), I don't think anyone would be happy at having a key ingredient left out and still have it served without mention of it. Felt a bit gypped. I would have felt better if they mentioned some kind of discount or asked if we would still like it, but the waitress just smiled and walked away. We decided not to send it back: the tuna was cut with a lot of seasoning and was swimming in a soy sauce-based liquid, which made the tuna fall apart and incredibly hard to eat. For $18, and a tiny portion, I would not recommend ordering this.

We also ordered the James Bond roll (my boyfriends favorite), the ooka dragon roll (my favorite, loved the fresh eel) and also the Hana roll (had an odd beef topping and an over abundance of herbal seasoning; very salty. Would not recommend)

Overall, ooka impressed me with its ambience and fresh ingredients, but their service and price I think are disappointing.",2,"bad"
