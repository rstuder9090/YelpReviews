"2","This place made me do a u-turn.  Not because I'd ever heard of it before, but because I am really unfamiliar with this part of town and I happened to see the store while at a red light and was in the far lane.  I'm really glad I turned around.  

I had not been to a Farmer's Market since leaving New York City and I'm glad I stopped by.  There were tons of bins of fruit and veggies, some of which I recognized from episodes of ""Chopped"" on Food Network, others that I had never seen or heard of.  They also carry nopales!  I hadn't seen the cactus fronds or the prickly pear fruit in a store since a long ago trip I had taken to West Texas. 

I went pretty tame on my first visit here.  Cucumbers, lemons, mint and some cheese.  The prices were extremely affordable compared to the sticker shock you get for ""organics"" in some grocery stores. 

  I did enjoy the variety in this small but very clean store.  There was definitely an Asian bodega vibe, and tons of bamboo trees as well as other flowering plants to choose from.  In addition to a sweets section, they also refill bottled water here. 

I can't wait for my next haircut up the street for a chance to explore this store and its contents more thoroughly.",1,"good"
"3","Natural Market is a terrific little farmer's market located along Gunn Highway, right at the intersection of Casey Road. The market is small with it's own private parking lot out in front of the store. The bright green awning says ""Farmer's Market"" but the sign along the roadway says ""Natural Market"".

Once inside you'll find a collection of the freshest local produce and freshly cut flowers. The market has a nice mix of Asian, Latin, and average-American grocery favorites, and the prices are remarkably fair. There is one whole refrigerated case devoted to herbs, another for juices, milk, farm-fresh eggs, etc.

I picked up bottles of sesame oil, pickled okra, good Spanish olives and capers, freshly-squeezed juices, and a bunch of fresh fruits and veggies, and my bill was under $30.

Very pleasant folks behind the counter, and really helpful customer service.",2,"good"
