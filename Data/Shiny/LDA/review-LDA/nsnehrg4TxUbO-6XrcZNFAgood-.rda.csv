"2","This restaurant has a different vibe than what you would expect from a sushi restaurant. It feels like they should be serving burgers and fries with the Rock memorabilia surrounding the restaurant and a very standard quick dine in restaurant.

Surprisingly the sushi was really good. We ordered a selection to give this place a solid chance. We got the Guns N Roses and Michael Jackson Rolls for our deep fried selection and I'll review those first. Deep Fried rolls are always my favorite and I really enjoyed the flavor explosion the Guns N Roses roll gave me. It had the Eel sauce on top which gave it the sweetness, the cream cheese in the middle to give it the creaminess, the spicy mayo to give a little kick, the deep fry and the crunchy flakes to give it a crunch on each bite. I also really enjoyed the simplicity of it. The Michael Jackson is essentially the same roll itself minus the toppings. The crab meat on top really gives it a different flavor and is almost an overload, which made it one of my least favorites.

The other rolls we ordered consisted of the Cindy Lauper, a Salmon Nigiri (2 piece), and the rainbow roll. 

The Cindy Lauper was definitely the highlight. The flavor profile was intense! I loved the roll itself but the seared tuna and the toppings are what elevate this to the top. The synergy between the jalape√±os and strawberries working together give you a mouthwatering experience that makes your tastebuds excite and crave more. 

The other rolls were on par with traditional sushi. I would say the fish was exceptionally fresh and NOT slimy or smelly. This is how I determine how good the sushi will be. So each bite was refreshing and was the perfect pallet cleanse between rolls! 

Our waiter was also really great. It wasn't crowded but he gave us what we needed and wasn't to much in our faces which was nice. Overall great experience, only thing I would change is not ordering the Michael Jackson roll and maybe having a little different ambience.",1,"good"
"3","I talked with Steve, he was very nice, and accommodating, as I came in late, a half hour before they closed. So, even though it was 8:30, Steve was kind enough to let me dine in, as Sushi and Hibachi items are of the moment, and best when eaten just after being served. Their Miso is the best I have had in all  the years I have eaten Sushi, since I was introduced to it,in 1991. The Miso had such a great flavor, and the seaweed was not anywhere near as salty as all of the other Miso soup so I have had in Nashville. Next,the ginger dressing on their salad was so wonderful I had to call the waitress over and remark on how good it was, and she told me that they make the dressing there, I love ginger, but most of the ginger dressings are available at Japanese restaurants and supply stores, and are very much the same. Their dressing made me eat every single piece of that lettuce on the plate. I told the waitress that I would've licked the plate if there weren't people in there! And a since there was not the time to really peruse their wonderful menu in depth, and I really enjoyed reading all of the rock sushi rolls that they make, and they are very different from a lot of the rolls you get anywhere else. And knowing that it takes a little while to roll them,I decided to give the chef a break, and just order from the hibachi grill,and also got an order of those great chicken eggrolls, which were delicious with the chili dipping sauce. In retrospect, I perhaps should've ordered several of the rock designated rolls, because they were among the most creative I have seen! And that gives me a great reason to come back! And not to mention the decor is great, the music is great, with the monitor screens of the videos, it was exactly my genre when I was playing alternative rock in Nashville,, back in the day! And the starburst light fixtures are awesome, and I collect 50s furniture and fixtures, much like those starburst lamps, so I was really liking the decor!
Back to the entree', the veggies were great, and still crisp, but just that perfect stir-fry to take the edge off the raw carrots, and not overdo the broccoli, a perfect balance, and the fried rice was great and seemed to have a smoky flavor more than just soy, that made it different from other fried rice I've had in Nashville. And the steak bites were tender, delicious, and just like I ordered them, medium rare! And I tried to hurry, to not keep up past the closing time, but Steve said, take your time, and enjoy it! And I really did! Everything about their restaurant is totally awesome, from the creative rolls on album cover menus, the food, impeccable service and very congenial and accommodating staff, the decor, music, what a perfect experience! I will most definitely tell people about the great sushi restaurant they have got going on!",2,"good"
