"2","I've been here a handful of times and I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed it. Well, I'm making amends now!

The first time I came, I came alone, when I was interviewing for my current job, at the recommendation of a friend who used to live here. I sat at the sushi bar and had a nice relaxing evening.

I introduced another friend here, and it was good. So good, she's practically a regular here. We came again tonight and one of the ladies already had a pile of ginger that she gave to my friend. 

Tonight we had the Spider roll, Caterpillar roll, spicy tuna, spicy scallop and a salmon roll. I also had a miso soup, as my friend kept talking about making miso, and I was starving, so it was a nice opening to the meal.

The fish was fresh and tonight's favorite for me was the salmon roll. It is a basic roll with salmon and avocado. Can we just say ""YUM?!"" The salmon was awesome and there was just the right amount of avocado in every bite. 

Second up was definitely the Caterpillar roll. Clearly, I'm a fan of avocado, but this was just so good! The other rolls were pretty good, but didn't stand out as much as the two that I just described.

I enjoyed the miso as well. I don't know why I don't come more often. Something tells me that that's about to change!",1,"good"
"3","The aura of great authenticity that Ichiban surpasses is beyond me. From the darling Japanese styled seating area, to the swords decorating the entryway, Ichiban is the most authentic Japanese dining experience I've had in Santa Barbara.

THE STAFF- 

The first few times I visited here I would use either an Axxess deal or a Groupon and the way the waitress would calculate the receipt would always be off by a few $$. I do think businesses should honor their deals, and it's a shame on their part because it would have been five stars.

Other than receipt miscalculations for deals, their staff are very quick and insightful, I'm never having to track down a waiter or if I'm at the Sushi bar, I never feel like I'm pressed for time.

THE FOOD- 

Lately I've been begining my sushi endeavours with fresh-water eel ($8.00) sashimi or nigiri, and it always falls palatable to the start of my meal.

I really enjoy their Mesa roll ($12.95), 007 roll ($13.95), and their mouthwatering Chef Special roll ($18.75). All of them come with a lot of spicy mayo so there's really no need to ask for a side of it.

Ichiban is one of the best Japanese restaurants in SB, in terms of food quality, and real Japanese authenticity. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",2,"good"
