"2","---UPDATED REVIEW 02/27/2014---
I've been back to Crazy Sushi probably a dozen or so times in the past 12+ months and have had a fantastic experience each and every time.

The staff is always so friendly, welcoming, accommodating, and provide all-around excellent service.  

I've tried many of their specialty rolls, and obviously have favorites among them - but I enjoy them all and find their creativity a huge plus. Seaweed salad is delicious, too!

I've taken a number of visiting friends to Crazy Sushi and everyone has always had a fantastic meal and enjoyed their overall experience.

Nothing but positive words for Crazy Sushi!


---ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/28/2012---

Crazy Sushi isn't groundbreaking or the best reasonably priced sushi around, but I had an overall very enjoyable experience and will be returning shortly.

I went on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was practically empty, which was nice, and allowed my party to enjoy our bottle of wine that we brought (BYO = huge plus.) 

I ordered a green salad (average), miso soup (could've been much warmer), and two sushi rolls: an Eel Avocado Roll and the Spicy Tuna roll. Both rolls were delicious and everyone at our table received their rolls presented in a different and exciting arrangement. Our rolls came out quickly and tasted fresh.

The service was very nice. The wait staff checked in frequently to make sure we were doing ok (probably because the restaurant was so empty, but it was still appreciated.) Also, the current promotion was another plus: if you spend more than $30, you receive $5 off, and if you spend more than $50, you receive $10 off your bill. 

Next time I go, I might be more adventurous and try a special roll or something different, but I was content with my meal and the overall experience.",1,"good"
"3","If you're looking for affordable, yet quality sushi, one of my favorite spots to recommend would have to be Crazy Sushi in the Rittenhouse area. An added bonus? It's BYO! 

It's a slim, sleek space with comfortable seating and a sushi bar at the end. 

Salad
 
Salad was fairly standard with fresh Romaine. The ginger dressing was clearly freshly made. 

Vampire Bowl [$9]
Spicy tuna tartare, avocado bowl
  
A must order in my mind is the Vampire Bowl, their unique take on tuna tartare. I loved the contrast in textures with the crunch from the tempura and the creaminess of the avocado bowl. The sweet wasabi mayo was balanced by the light heat from the spicy tuna. 

Vegetable Tempura [$5]

The GF's a sucker for veggie tempura and this didn't disappoint. A thin layer of tempura coated mushrooms, sweet potato, and carrots. It came accompanied with a light tempura dipping sauce. 

Beef Negimaki [$6]
Scallion, thin-sliced beef, teriyaki
  
On this trip, the negimaki was a bit disappointing. The beef could have been more thinly sliced and better seasoned, though I appreciated the bite of the scallion amidst the teriyaki glaze. 

Triple Sushi [$25]
Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tuna roll

The triple sushi featured some of our favorite nigiri rolls, including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. All very clean-tasting and fresh, the platter also came with a tuna roll. I appreciated that the tuna was whole and not minced within the sushi. 

Uni Sushi [$8]

I was also in the mood for uni so asked for an order of uni sushi. Then again, when am I *not* in the mood for uni? Sourced from California, these were creamy, light, and buttery. 

Bloomingdale Roll [$13]
Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail, spicy shrimp, avocado, longan
  
I was also intrigued by their Bloomingdale specialty roll. The pink seaweed seemed a bit more delicate in texture and taste, supporting the sweetness of the lychee. This contrasted with the subtly spicy mixture of tuna, salmon, crab yellowtail, and shrimp (whoa!). Due to the laundry list of items, the flavors were a bit muddled, but definitely veers toward the sweeter side of a sushi roll. Interesting! 

Sweet Potato Roll [$5]

Of course, we also had to try our standard sweet potato roll. Crazy Sushi has one of the best iterations, with a wonderful juxtaposition of creaminess from the sweet potato and a light crunch on the exterior. The black sesame seeds studding the surrounding rice made for a perfect bite. 

So if you're not looking to go omakase and want a relaxed sushi meal, I'd recommend checking out Crazy Sushi. Whether you're looking for Americanized rolls or nigiri done right, they've got you covered.",2,"good"
"4","I'm not one to write reviews (the only other time I've written one was when I had bugs crawling on my table and my legs at another restaurant), but the service that I received at this restaurant was not the best. The food that I had at dinner was okay (pretty good sushi for the price). What wasn't fine was the way that I was treated when I called back the next morning (I'll explain). After leaving the restaurant the night before, I realized that I had accidentally left a large amount of cash on the table (not talking about the $6 cash tip I had also left for my $27 meal) before walking out and wasn't able to go back to retrieve it because I had left the restaurant at closing time. I called them back the next day as soon as they opened up and explained to them what had happened. While a very small part of me was hoping that I'd be able to get my money back, as it was pretty obvious that I had dropped it on the table by accident (I had set aside my cash tip with my receipt, so that extra cash wad was obviously not supposed to be there), I really just wanted them to at least speak nicely to me on the phone. However, I was met with a lot of confusion/disbelief by the man that I was talking to on the phone and eventually told to ""hold on."" The man went on to have multiple conversations with employees at the restaurant while I was still on the phone (no, I wasn't put on hold). Eventually, he came back on the phone call and told me that he had just asked all of the servers who were there the night before if they had picked up the amount of cash I had lost, but everyone had claimed not to. I nicely told the man on the phone that I had a feeling that my server was not telling the truth and most likely pocketed the money instead of splitting the tips with the rest of the servers (as they do at Crazy Sushi), because I remembered leaving the money on the table. Again, I was met with disbelief and an accusatory tone, then told to hold again. Like last time, I wasn't put on hold, and heard him and a woman screaming back and forth at each other, presumably about me. At that point, I was 100% sure that the man either knew that my server was lying about taking the money or that the money had been split amongst the servers at the end of the night. He eventually came back on the phone to tell me that he asked the servers again (which he couldn't have done since he was yelling the whole time) and they all claimed not to have picked up the money. 

Long story short, I simply wanted someone to be nice to me on the phone, regardless of the outcome -- it would have been nice to have received a simple apology for the possibility of my server picking up the money and pocketing it, as I knew that the money was probably long gone at that point. However, I was met with a lot of disbelief and an overall unprofessional, rude, and possibly dishonest attitude.",1,"bad"
"5","The rating I give is not for the food, but for the service and management of the establishment.

I found a Groupon for Crazy Sushi (20$ for 40$ worth of food) and decided to go with a friend. I noticed it was BYO so we picked up a bottle of wine, which made us a little late for our 8:30 PM reservation. Fortunately, we were still seated relatively quickly, although our being seated was very awkward. The hostess led us to a half cleaned table and made us wait as we watched them clear it up. She also left the menus on the sushi bar which was a few feet away from our table, so when we were finally seated, we had to go grab the menus ourselves. The restaurant was pretty full, as almost every single table was seated. So perhaps service was backed up for this reason?

Anyway, it was a while before anyone came by to offer us water, at which point we asked for our wine to be uncorked. They came back soon after, with our uncorked wine (sans ice bucket...) and 2 glasses of water, one of which they spilled ALL over me. My shirt, from my stomach area, down to my knees was drenched. The waiter seemed horrified, apologized, but then started tending to the water on the floor while I sat in shock, just sitting in a puddle of tap water. No help was offered to dry me off. I was not a happy camper at all. If I had not had a Groupon, I would have left immediately. I had a change of clothes in the car, which we parked just in front (lucky parking!), so it was fine. I'm not really that mad that they spilled water on me, because it gets worse.

When I got back from my change of clothes, my seat was haphazardly dried and some napkins were left on the table. We sat, and resumed examining the menu. We asked for an ice bucket, which came pretty late. Another waitress came by soon after to apologize for the mishap, and offered us a discount. She then URGED us to order another special roll (which I was originally reluctant to do, because we had already ordered so much), and then assured us that the discount would cut down the price enough that our Groupon would be enough to cover the entire bill. I think perhaps that the services' lack of English skills may have contributed to this miscommunication, because at the end of our meal, they gave us a complimentary red bean mochi ice cream and they called THAT our 'discount'. When we received the bill, there was no actual discount.

I was FURIOUS. We had ordered an extra special roll because the waitress had assured us that it would be taken care of with the discount, but found that there was no actual discount. We called a waiter to straighten out the issue, but the only excuse I got was that the machine wouldn't allow more than one discount per bill, and Groupon is apparently a discount. I'm still outraged at this. I had told them from the very beginning that I had a Groupon, yet they still assured me that they would have a discount, and then PUSHED us to order an extra roll.

Even with that whole situation aside, the service is still pretty lacking. It was pretty slow and hard to communicate with. We weren't given a single waiter (instead the waiters chaotically came by without reason or rhyme to check on us), yet this restaurant seems high class enough to have a systematic waiting system.


The reason I didn't rate this place 1 star is the food. The 'normal' rolls were fresh, delicious. The hamachi-scallion roll was delightful and the scallion came through perfectly. There was a little too much crunch and grease for me in the cooked scallop roll, but it was still delicious. I highly recommend the Odessa roll, which is salmon wrapped around unagi, tuna, and masago. I didn't get too much of the masago, and perhaps there was a little too much eel sauce on top, but it was heavenly. The other special we ordered (that we were CONNED into ordering in my opinion) was the Long Island roll, which is eel tempura, spicy salmon wrapped with white tuna. That is the exact description of the roll on the menu, yet when it came out, it was covered in this overly sweet, sweet and sour chicken reminiscent sauce. It ruined the roll in my opinion, and had I known that the roll came in this sauce, I would not have ordered it. I would stay away from the Long Island if you actually like the taste of sushi.

-------
Sorry for the wall of text! 

IN SHORT: If the service and management here gets a HUGE make over, this would definitely be one of my regular BYO's in the city. As is, I am hesitant to return. Perhaps I will get take out for the Odessa roll, about which I wil have dreams forever.

Come here for good food and terrible service.",2,"bad"
