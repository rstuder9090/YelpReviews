"2","Our new favorite sushi joint now that sushi alive has moved across town. It is small authentic and I believe family owned. It is not a trendy upscale hotspot.  It is a bright clean quiet place where you can dress comfortably and bring the whole family. We were seated in  a private booth right away on a saturday night at 6:45pm.  Our server was a pleasant young man who was very professional and attentive and brought our food out very quickly. Their happy hour special is pretty amazing with many choices of $3 rolls and $1 Nigiri and they even offer it on fri & sat evenings (until 7pm) which is kind of unheard of. They offer many fruit flavored sakes which I enjoy trying raspberry is my favorite so far but I can't wait to try the lychee!! We had steamed gyoza which were hot & delicious.  The veggie tempura is pretty good and comes with 2 pcs each of broccoli sweet potato carrot and onion although the dipping sauce tasted a little watery. The sushi and Nigiri were all very fresh. In particular the spicy tuna roll was excellent and I will order it every time. My only disappointment with this restaurant is that they don't offer any real crab rolls only krabstick.",1,"good"
"3","Sushi-Haru is a tiny little sushi bar and Japanese restaurant located along Northdale Boulevard in northern Carrollwood, directly across the street from Whole Foods. I was planning a trip to Whole Foods one evening, and wanted to find a place for dinner. My trusty Yelp bookmarks alerted me to Sushi-Haru, and off I went to eat fishies.

Behind the traditional cloth curtain divider at Sushi-Haru, you'll find a small sushi bar with seating for 8 patrons. There are also some small private booth areas for families and groups. On the night that I was there, the restaurant was staffed by one lady who took the orders, delivered the food, and cleaned up the tables. There was also a gentleman behind the sushi bar, who doubled as the cook in their prep kitchen. Perhaps they have more helpers during busier times, but the place was spotlessly clean, and run very efficiently despite the small staff.

There is a sushi bar menu with traditional nigiri and sashimi options, and dozens and dozens of different sushi rolls. They also have a full Japanese foods menu, but I didn't bother looking as I was only interested in the sushi. If you're a lover of sushi rolls, then you'll find about 60 on the menu, and a few more on their specials board. You'll need some time to read through everything, and decide upon your favorites.

I ordered a seaweed salad to start while watching the sushi chef prepare someone else's dinner. Once I was satisfied with his technique and the freshness of the fish in the case, I placed an order for a nigiri platter with a wide variety of sushi choices. My platter had the usual tuna, yellow tail, salmon, mackerel, and whitefish, but I also added spicy tuna, yellowtail, conch, and scallop. Unlike a lot of sushi restaurants, the chef prepared the spicy nigiri using finely-chopped fish, rather than the usual minced gruel. The fish and seafood were very fresh and delicious, and the chef's sushi rice had the perfect balance of vinegar, sugar, and salt. Nothing was dripping with sauces, and so you were able to taste the fish, and not some gastromolecular gooey topping.

I was quite surprised by the quality of the sushi in this small restaurant, and decided to finish my meal with a real Japanese delicacy -- sweet head-on shrimp. The head of the shrimp is separated from the rest of the body, dipped in a very light tempura batter, and flash fried. The body of the shrimp is left raw. You can slurp the shrimp brains, and then chomp on the shrimp body - much like eating a crawfish. It's not for everyone, but a real treat for those who like it.

Sushi-Haru serves up some very delicious sushi, and it's worth a visit if you want to try something very tasty for dinner. Oh, and don't worry, they also serve the usual deep-fried, stuffed with cream cheese, and covered with sauces kinda rolls that are so popular.",2,"good"
