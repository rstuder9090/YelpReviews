"2","VERY fresh sushi! Prompt service and a nice atmosphere as well.  The only downside is the location of where the waitresses have to enter orders.  They really need to relocate that behind the brick wall as all we could hear is complaining about not getting a top from a customer and the management lady griping about one of the girls eating her lunch.

I literally watched the older manager grab the girls food from the booth she was in and throw her food away.  Could you not have sat it in the back, is there no break area other than the lobby? I felt bad for her, she had to pay for that food too.  Totally unprofessional to have acted in such a manor directly in front of us.

Anyway, they are still fairly fresh and getting it together.  Maybe they will see this and make some needed adjustments.  I wish I could remember the name of our waitress because she was wonderful!",1,"good"
"3","Heard of this place from my wife's co-worker on their Gand opening. So, I thought we'd give this Grand Opening a try. And, kinda weird at first maybe because they were playing 60's music in a Japanese restaurant. Server was pleasant and prompt and so was our order. My wife ordered the shrimp lunch bento box and I ordered the steak bento box and a side order of sushi special 2 for the price of one. And...it was pretty good.",2,"good"
