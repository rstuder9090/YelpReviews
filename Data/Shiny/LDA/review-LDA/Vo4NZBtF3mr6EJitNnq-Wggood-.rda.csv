"2","Well let me just say, what a delightful surprise to find originality in take-out. This location has everything a person would want to have on a Saturday evening. Fresh flavors to excite the palette in every bite. The pizza was really excellent. I ordered a have white half cheese pie. The crust was chewy and thin. The perfect ratio from sauce to cheese was again everything I needed. The sushi was melt in your mouth scrumptious. The pickle veggies were crisp, elegantly displayed and super tasty. I can't wait to order again. I see this little business will be booming in no time.",1,"good"
"3","You guys, this place is legit!  Truth be told, I had already eaten a (light) meal nearby, but I was so excited to find it that I spent $20 on a Tomato Pie and Tartar Jar (salmon) just to try it!  The tomato pie was served piping hot out of the pizza oven, on a gorgeous bubbly and slightly charred crust.  Delicious sauce!  The tartar jar was fresh and tasty, and pretty much good enough for me to live on daily for the rest of my life!  
It's a takeout place, but they have a handful of outdoor tables.  Grab a bottle of wine down at the other end of the shopping center and definitely plan on enjoying a nice casual meal on the patio right there if the weather's nice!",2,"good"
