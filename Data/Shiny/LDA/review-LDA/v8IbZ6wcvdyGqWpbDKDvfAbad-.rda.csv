"2","As other Yelpers have mentioned this is a great concept and the first of its' kind in Tampa. The tapas\sushi conveyor belt idea is fun and interesting. All of the bubble saucer plates, shouts from the cooks, ""Yo Yo"", put us into sensory overload. If you are an indecisive person this is not the restaurant for you. The plates of sushi and other dishes swirl at  a fast pace. I grabbed at least 2 plates on impulse. Bring a calculator because each plate is a different price based on color. For example the green plate is 3 dollars and the yellow plate is 7 dollars ( I wonder if color blind people pay more because of this). Breakdown of some of items  that I tried:

Iced Green Tea: Matcha based, excellent quality, and free refils: 5/5
California Roll (purple plate): Average flavor not real crab I have had better at most resturants: 2/5
Black Sesame Dorayaki (purple plate) Love the raspberry sauce, great sesame flavor, ate 2 plates: 5/5
Chicken Fire Cracker Rice (orange plate): Decent well seasoned, not spicy, not much chicken: 3.5/5
Chicken Katsu (orange plate): Solid choice, good sauce, fair portion: 4/5

In the future I will avoid the sushi and order more hot entrees. I enjoyed most of the chicken dishes. For lunch with tip my wife and I payed just under $50.00 dollars and were still hungry. Next time I will control my impulses and study the menu more before grabing plates.",1,"good"
"3","Yo! Sushi is a totally new concept for Tampa. It's conveyor-belt sushi also known as kaiten-sushi or kaiten-zushi or sushi-go-round in Japan. You sit at a booth and grab the sushi you want and pay at the end.

My first experience with this kind of sushi was in San Francisco when I first tried sushi as a 5-year old at Isobune Sushi in Japantown and I have longed for a conveyor-belt style sushi place to come to Tampa since I moved here in 1999. Yo! Sushi is finally making that a reality.

The style of Yo! Sushi is modern and different from Isobune. The focus is on fast, fresh, and convenient and the setup of the place follows this focus. When you walk-up to the restaurant it's open and easy to get a seat at. Call-buttons are placed at each table to make it easy to get service and close your check.

Sushi is constantly being rolled and made by the sushi chefs at the restaurant and the open-kitchen let's you watch the chefs in action. I have faith a high-traffic area like the International Plaza will help ensure the freshness of the fish at Yo! Sushi. 

Plates range from $3-$6 and contain a variety of cooked and raw sushi, cooked Japanese food, and dessert. There's a little bit of something for everyone depending on your tastes. 

One of my favorite things I have tried so far is the Chicken Katsu Curry which comes a small plate with rice below and about 5 cuts of katsu for $5. I often want to order katsu at restaurants, but find it hard to justify spending $15 on dinner for one - especially when I also want sushi with my food and end up just ditching the katsu. This meets me halfway.

As far as the sushi is concerned - it tastes fresh and is certainly above what you would find at a buffet or something like Koizi/Saki Endless Sushi. It's not quite the highest quality of sushi which is understandable considering the price and focus, but still satisfactory to me for the taste. Most of the sushi leans towards salmon, tuna, and imitation crab/crab special or California Roll-creations. 

I also liked the Popcorn Shrimp (tastes more like Bang Bang Shrimp), Takoyaki (hard to find a decent one in Tampa for sure!), and the Kimchi Salmon Steamed Bun (bun was just right and salmon pretty good quality!). There are plenty of things to try though so repeat visits will need to be made!

For me, Yo! Sushi is great for a quick and tasty meal when I'm in a rush and don't necessarily want to spend as much time/money at a regular Japanese sushi restaurant. I can see how someone who wants a really high-end Japanese experience may not approve, but then one should also consider price and time into factors of that justification.

The service is friendly/approachable and the managers clearly really love working for Yo! Sushi which is something plenty of restaurants in Tampa Bay seem to lack and may come from them being an international company.

Definitely check it out even if it's just to try something new for fun with some friends or family. I know I'll be back often!",2,"good"
"4","Went here with my daughter during a shopping spree, and I was disappointed. In fact, the restaurant is pretty bad!  

I do like the innovative concept of the sushi conveyor belt, and the temptation of various sushi bowls floating past your face is too much to resist. Yum!  But inevitably, you start grabbing too much stuff, and then the prices add up beyond expectation.  We both have good appetites, but $80 (pre-tip) for lunch with my teenager is way too much!  If you have more discipline than I do, you might do better here. 

But here are the two real problems:

1)  The service was less than mediocre. The waitress who seated us could not have cared less, and our waiter was pretty hapless.  There seemed to be plenty of management around, but overall the atmosphere is not conducive of any love or care for the diner experience.  Admittedly, the setting in a huge rotunda of International Plaza may not be the most intimate, but I have had better service at Jimmy John's or even Johnny Rockets. This just feels like a big chain where nobody -- from the chefs, to the waiters, to the management -- cares about the end product.  It was alienating. 

Furthermore, for items we ordered from the kitchen, service was slow!  My daughter and I could not help but wonder if this was a corporate conspiracy to force us to grab more items off the line while we waited for our custom dishes. And how long have those conveyor belt items been sitting there anyway?  Is this how they move the product?

2) While I gobbled everything put in front of me and am always grateful for raw fish, the sushi was pretty bad in retrospect. There was lite emphasis on tuna and yellow tail, the most highly prized sushi.  On the other hand, there is a heavy emphasis on mayonnaise, krab, and sea weed salad.  This is the cheap stuff, concealing the fact that the fish is not as fresh as could be.  For the prices, this sushi did not break the quality meter.  

YO sushi would be better off as an all-you-can-eat sushi concept, or more properly for what it is, a discount sushi spot with cool bells and whistles.  If this meal had been $25 or even $40, I would have been satisfied; or at least I would understand what I was getting.  YO sushi should be cheap sushi at reasonable prices.  Instead, it is bad sushi outrageously over priced. 

I doubt I will try this restaurant again.  As they say, fool me once...",1,"bad"
"5","I'm from Hawaii and so I know what sushi should look and taste like in a conveyor belt because we have a lot of those in Hawaii.  Conveyor belt sushi are considered ""fast sushi"" and items like kappa maki or miso soup are only $1.50 and NOT $3 like Yo sushi.  I will even post a photo of what a $3.50 hamachi nigiri should look like.  They charge $2.75 for green tea when it should complimentary on a conveyor belt ""fast food"" sushi.  I got some ebi, ahi, hamachi and salmon nigiri and as you can see from the photo, the size of the fish is tiny for $5.  Worst is that husband got sushi from the belt and he said it taste as if that's been sitting there for more than 2 hours.  Note, sushi is only good for 2 hours in room temperature or else that is bad already. Conveyor belt sushi chef in Hawaii keep track of what they put and we see them dispose of the things they know have been sitting out for a while.  The most horrible part was the $7 hamachi carpaccio wannabe they had and it was not either hamachi or it was very old hamachi.  The texture and taste was more mackerel ""saba"" (a much cheaper sushi fish than hamachi).  Never going back there and the bill was $50 which in Hawaii that would have fed 4 people with a full stomach at Genki or Sushi Bay or Kurukuru and at Yo Sushi, we had to buy a pretzels to get rid of the bad hamachi taste and to satisfy our stomach. This place has terrible sushi and a big rip off.",2,"bad"
