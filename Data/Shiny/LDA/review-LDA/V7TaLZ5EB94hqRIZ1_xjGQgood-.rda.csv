         Kawa is a great choice of a restaurant to go for lunch or dinner. They have delicious food for everyone and their personal tastes. No matter what you order you will probably like it a lot. The decor and music are very good along with good seats. The service is spectacular with each waitress having a large knowledge of the menu. The price there is cheap in comparison to other Japanese restaurants, at least for now. If you dine at Kawa you are sure to be at least satisfied and have a good time. 

 Kawa is a brilliant restaurant in many of its aspects. My family and I dined there and it was an absolutely fabulous experience. Everyone was pleased with what they were fed. ""It's the best Spicy Tuna I've ever had."" -Mom. The spring rolls I received were delicious and were served in a fantastic way. This restaurant has some ridiculous sushi and other seafood, but it does cater to vegetarians like myself extremely well. All the dishes I ordered were very tasty, and, according to my family, I didn't even get the best dishes. Each of them loved the salmon skewers, the squid, and almost everything they ordered. There was a dish or two that was liked, not loved, but overall the food was amazing. The dessert there is exotic and delectable. From shaved ice to tempura ice cream, whatever you get you will love. As a bonus, Kawa has awesome Japanese Marble Sodas to die for. Our service was very good at this restaurant. Our waitress was very polite and kind to us when she conversed with us. She had a great knowledge of the menu as she helped us create a special order. When we were doing this, she was very patient with us as she explained everything. At Kawa, there is a high chance you will love what you get as an appetizer, entree, or dessert. 

     Although the food at Kawa is at a very high level, that isn't the only amazing part of this restaurant. They have a fairly good decor on the walls, from paintings to the climbing fish. On a TV screen, the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a very good Japanese food documentary, plays on a loop with subtitles. The seating they have set up on the wall is very unique with circular pillow-like cushions for you to sit on. They are quite comfortable and interesting. While we were there we heard many funny songs, like a saxophone playing Hotel California, If You're Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands in Japanese, and other songs. The decor and such of Kawa is great, but here you get a lot for your money. Appetizers and Entrees range from $6 to $20, which is a pretty good deal on its own. But, most Japanese places charge a lot more for their food, making this restaurant a sweet deal in comparison.

"3","They're doing an amazing job with takeout during the COVID-19 pandemic! Ordering online through their website was super easy and I was impressed with the online ordering software and their sleek website. An employee has their voice projected outside with a speaker so it's easy to hear orders called out, but you're also texted right when it's ready for pickup in case you're not outside. Their time estimate for when our food would be ready was spot-on. (45 mins for ramen and sushi on a Saturday at 6:30pm, not bad.) 

We hadn't had ramen since February due to the pandemic but are so glad we bit the bullet to try it takeout-style. The broth comes in a separate container that you just pour over the broth and voila! I was worried about the noodles at first since they were sticking together and felt weird, but after letting them get warmed up by the broth for 5 minutes they were normal again! The broth was a bit too salty IMO (and I love salt), but it still hit the spot so no stars off. 

As for sushi, the Godzilla Roll was amazing - who doesn't love a deep fried roll - and the eel and tuna rolls were very good. 

We grabbed our food and then drove to Veterans Memorial Park in Springfield, PA, a quick 3-min drive away. It's a beautiful park with multiple picnic tables and a wonderful large playground if you have kids. Clean bathrooms which are well kept and stocked with soap and paper towels! Highly recommend this park for eating dinner outside.",2,"good"
