"2","It's definitely a solid place if you're in the area and need cheap delivery.  Everything we ate was decently good, the delivery was quick, and the prices were great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but the food is reliably decent and you can't beat it for the price.

The egg drop soup with wontons was pretty good.  The texture was a little odd, but the flavor was definitely there.

The curry shrimp fried rice was very tasty.  It was probably my favorite thing that we got, and there was a lot more shrimp than I was expecting for how little we paid.

The sesame chicken was okay.  I'm not a fan of the type they have (breaded chicken in red sauce), but that's my fault for not asking.  

The crispy wontons we got on the side were yummy.

My boyfriend says that the chicken wings were pretty good.  Not something to write home about, but way better than McDonalds or any other fast food.

Food was about a 3, price was a 5, so I'm giving it a 4.",1,"good"
"3","I live in South Seminole Heights and work in Westchase a few days a week. I drive by this little restaurant every time I go to and from work and have ALMOST stopped several times. I went to the gym after work last week and was driving home from Clearwater STARVING and finally gave in to my craving. 

This place is right next to Wing House and since the Stanley Cup finals were on I almost went there. However, I looooove sushi and really don't like sports/wing bars so decided I would have to miss the game. Lucky me!! There was a flat screen TV showing the game...with volume...behind the sushi bar! 

I was acknowledged in a friendly manner and offered to choose where I wanted to sit, which was nice since sometimes women alone at dinner time are assumed to be waiting for a man. I chose a seat at the sushi bar and made my choices. I got a triple roll (yellowtail, tuna, salmon), a philly roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese), ika (squid) sashimi, and unagi (eel) nigiri. I don't like cucumber so all items were ordered without and arrived as such...big happy face. For $20 I really enjoyed my food. Everything was fresh and tasty and the rolls were neatly made. The only thing was that the eel pieces kind of fell apart...but that's just because they were large pieces. The pair arrived hot and with plenty of eel sauce (just about my favorite thing). 

The restaurant is really tiny, about 6 seats at the sushi bar and maybe 10 tables indoors. There's a large outdoor covered patio with a fish pond and fountain. The restrooms are outside. The photos on the Yelp site really don't look like they were taken here. Although the seats at the bar and some of the shelving is the same, the colors and layout of the building don't match up with what I saw. I'm wondering if there's a 2nd location? 

The Chinese food other people were ordering looked and smelled good and from what they were saying it tasted good too. I look forward to going back with my boyfriend (who likes Chinese food but won't touch ANY seafood).",2,"good"
"4","First and foremost let me say that I've tried so hard to like this place. I've tried them 3-4 times (3 times too many) and I've been disappointed every single time. I've tried their Sushi and I've tried their Chinese food and both are MEDIOCRE at best. I truly don't know how anyone could recommend this place. 

Today I ordered a Vegetable roll, an Avocado Cucumber roll, an Avocado roll and the Vegetable Pan Fried Udon noodles. I had the Vegetable and Avocado rolls tempura (which, btw, is $3 extra for each roll which is super pricy as compared to other restaurants). My avocado roll was pretty disappointing. How do you mess up an AVOCADO roll? It has pretty much a little microscopic piece of BROWN avocado and I added cream cheese, for $6.75 DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT. The Vegetable roll was fine (according to my significant other because I refused to eat any of them because of the disappointment) and the avocado cucumber roll had the same quality avocado in it. This order totaled in $32.78, AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY.

I requested extra ginger for the sushi actually received NO GINGER and no wasabi with any of the sushi orders. Along with the 3 rolls they gave us 4 packets of soy sauce. Can't comment on the udon noodles because, again, didn't even eat it after my disappointment with this place. In my prior orders I have tried their Honey Chicken and the meat was HIGHLY questionable which made me reluctant to order from this place prior to this order. Same goes for their General tso's chicken. 

So all in all, if you like good quality food, please don't waste your time and subject your body to such mediocrity- you'll thank me later!",1,"bad"
"5","Called to place nice size order on sushi spring rolls, the lady who took order was horrible! Really nasty and mean ! I was like Huh?
Anyway being a responsible person I went to pick up thinking maybe she was just busy.  When i got there (the door looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years) (filthy)
That should have told me then there to get out now. I picked it up thinking i don't want them to get stuck with food. I received food from same Lady  so nasty and mean again went home took it out. Ate one piece of sushi and knew something wasn't right 1 out of 18 pieces i ate woke up 8 hours later throwing up violently :( it was that sushi I knew it.. when I smelled it the next day I knew OMG i was sick all day.
Do yourself a favor DON'T EAT THERE!  you can die from food poisoning...and they are not cheap over 15$ for just one person. But even if cheap not worth even if free! 
the spring rolls just as nasty, but cooked so not as deadly. I am following up with dirty dining to try and save someone else from being poisoned.
the springrolls were all breading and dripping with grease old grease.
take care 
if i could give no star it would be appropriate, but they won't let you submit w/o a star!",2,"bad"
