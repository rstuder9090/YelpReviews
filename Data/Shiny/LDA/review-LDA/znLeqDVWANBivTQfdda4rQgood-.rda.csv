"2","I looked at other peoples reviews that were negative about Zen Bistro and I am a little shocked.  My first time dining here was last weekend and we had an overall pleasant experience.  Of course, I don't have the historical context of having been there multiple times in the past but maybe they got a new front of house manager or someone that this pulling the place back on track? 

Anyway, the food was pretty fantastic.  We ordered a bunch or appetizers to start, with my favorite being the vegetable tempura and the beef satay a close second.  I ordered my two usual rolls: bagel roll and spice tuna roll, both of which were well done.  When it comes to sushi, I am pretty particular and I typically prefer a very thin layer of rice around the seaweed, they got very close to perfect on this.  Personally, there is no worse feeling than shoving a huge rice-ball-piece-of-sushi into your mouth inhibiting you from tasting the fish or other ingredients inside... ...but that might just be a personal preference :) 

I enjoyed the ambiance as it was pretty disarming and relaxing.  Lower dimmed lighting and a back lit tree trunk wall feature added a nice touch and texture to the wall. 

Service was not bad, nor was it amazingly punctual or mind blowing.  My rating is based on the food and decor alone.  Cheers!",1,"good"

Items I recommend: VOLCANO ROLL - best in town!  Serious.  I eat this roll everywhere I go.  COCONUT CURRY BEEF STEW - traditional beef stew in a beef stock gravy and a hint of coconut curry?  Are you serious?  This is one of the best fusion ideas I've seen to date.  It's served with some very fresh French bread, but order a side of rice and throw it in your bowl.  You won't be sad about this decision.  HONEY WALNUT ROCK SHRIMP - some of the meatiest shrimp I've ever seen.  Very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Then it's glazed with a wonderful honey sauce and topped with walnuts.  Look, I don't even LIKE walnut, and I found this dish to be nothing but amazing.  Never mind the fact that it's served with melon scoops and rice.  MISO SOUP - bangin'!  Better than I've had at most Japanese restaurants.  True story.  CURRIED CRAB DUMPLING - curried crab, cream cheese, minced raisins and cilantro wrapped in gyoza skins and fried until crispy served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  I mean, how much stuff can they shove into these things?  Just straight up DELICIOUS!

Ask for Marcella, she's the bee's knees.  I always look forward to my next visit for some House music and Asian-influenced grub!",2,"good"
