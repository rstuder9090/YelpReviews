"2","Its located conveniently just off Route 295 on Route 73. Owners are from South East Asia and hence the name of the restaurant. 

They serve mainly two types of food:
i) Sushi
ii) Singaporen-Malaysian

I've been there twice in 3 weeks and I must say that its one of the best sushi places in this area. Sushi is fresh and good. Prices are competitive ($17 for 15 pieces of sashimi). The tuna carpaccio is very nice. Most of the patrons tend to gravitate towards the sushi menu. I think its probably due to the fact that the people around here are not familiar with Malaysian/Singapore cuisine yet and hence it will take time for that to change.

As for the Singaporean/Malaysian dishes - I've only had the opportunity to try one basic dish (was too full to eat when I arrived there). The menu does boast some of the well known Malaysian/Singaporean dishes (curries, roti canai, satay, curry puffs etc..). I'll definitely will have to give those a try as the nearest 'Malaysian' restaurant is in downtown Philly.

As for the chef/owners - they're very accomodating and nice. Always giving out free appetizers for people who wait for take out orders (or even to the regulars there). 

I personally think that given time and some publicity, this place will definitely do well and will be bustling with more patrons (they are still a relatively new restaurant).

Update 8/29/07:
Ok I just came back tonight after giving the Malaysian/Singaporean dishes a try (needed a break from sushi). I'm upgrading the the Rating to 5 stars. I had:
1) Chicken Satay - Its really good - and they use chicken thighs (the right way to make good satay). I'll be trying the beef satay the next time
2) Chicken Rendang (dry chicken curry) - Felt like eating @ home in Malaysia. 

I must say that since I'll be coming here to NJ for the next few months for work, I'll definitely be spending at one night a week at this place as its just located near my hotel as there are so quite a few dishes to try.",1,"good"
"3","Just moved down here a few weeks ago, came from the metro NYC area and trying to scope out a new favorite sushi place. I've been spoiled up north, and frequent quality sushi is a requirement for my overall happiness and well being, so I was quite apprehensive at the start.

We stopped in today (Friday) around 12:30 for a quick lunch. We were greeted immediately and sat by a friendly woman who turned out to be our server as well. The place (small, 6 or 7 tables) was completely empty, and only two other parties came in the entire time we were there. This was lovely, as we could hear the jazz music playing in the background and service was quick and attentive. 

The menu is relatively small compared to what I'm used to, however there was still plenty to choose from and the maki lunch specials are a great deal. Onto the taste test-what a pleasant surprise! The shumai was rich in flavor and the accompanying sauce was slightly sweeter than what I am used to. Typically I wouldn't like this, but it was delicious. The sushi was very fresh and the proper temperature-not warm, but not cold enough to suggest it had spent the day sitting on a block of ice. Rice was the perfect texture as well. We had salmon, regular tuna, spicy tuna, and crab. All were great! 

While I have technically had better sushi in my life and I still have some exploring to do in the neighborhood, I can definitely say that I will be back and this place has a clear shot at becoming my favorite regular sushi spot. Definitely give it a try!",2,"good"
