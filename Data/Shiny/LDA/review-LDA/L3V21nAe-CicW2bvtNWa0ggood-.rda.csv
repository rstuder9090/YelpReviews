I used to frequent Mixx about 6 years ago, when the all you can eat was $20/pp. Then it was raised to $24 pp, and it just wasn't worth it anymore. All the reviews are right about them stuffing it with rice. I like the AYCE sushi places that allow you to grab one of everything (Minado) rather than a whole ROLL of something. That's why I stopped going. The rolls were stuffed with rice, and it just wasn't worth the $24+ tax anymore.

Last night was my first time back in YEARS. I only went because my other 8 friends wanted to go, so why not.

I still opted not to get the AYCE. I got the nori soup, Yamasai roll, spicy scallop roll and my bf got Roll Combo C for $15. Our whole bill including 18% tip and tax was $51 between the two of us AND we ended up taking almost 10+ pieces home with us.
- Nori soup: 3 stars. Standard, a little salty, but OK
- Yamasai roll: 4 stars - fish was relatively fresh - salmon, avocado and spicy tuna on top
- Spicy Scallop - 4 stars: very tasty :)
- Spicy yellowtail of Roll C: fresh, standard, good
- Tuna Avocado and Alaskan roll were also 3.5 to 4 stars- good standard sushi. I would compare the quality to Vic's in Rittenhouse
* They also put their wasabi in a cute flower form, I love that 
* Service was very friendly. We split out 10 table bill like.. 7 ways, and they didn't mind at all. BYOB is always a plus. For all these reasons they are a SOLID 4 stars

*****TIP*****
 My opinion is that you should only get the AYCE sushi $25pp if you can COMFORTABLY eat more than 24 pieces of sushi. Why? Their maki rolls (hand cut rolls) are very reasonably priced at $5 to $6 a roll. Each roll = 8 pieces. You can get the rolls individually anywhere from $15-$18 for 24 pieces of sushi (which is less than $25) OR you can get the ROLL COMBOs like my bf did for $15 which comes with salad or miso soup.
OR you can get the AYCE if you can comfortably eat 2 of the special rolls bc they are priced at $10-$13 a roll.

In my opinion, I left without feeling like I had to stuff my face on the verge of throwing up because they charge $1 for anything you don't finish eating. All my friends felt like puking, sleeping, dying afterwards. My bf and I enjoyed an amazing meal, with friendly service, with leftovers, OH and i forgot to mention our $51 dollar bill included mochi for dessert too! We will be back if we're in the area :)",1,"good"
"3","Visited tonight with my boyfriend and I we were both very pleased with the great service  and the sushi was good. But before I get into that, Interestingly enough I was surprised over the weekend to see the Yelp had listed Mixx being closed down and I had to see for myself If this was true. I had my suspicions. This  restaurant is not closed down and I don't know how or why that information was tagged on yelp. 

Anyway back to my experience. We both decided to get the  all you can eat sushi special for $25 a person. Considering each roll ranged from $8-15, it seemed worth it to get the deal,  The menu offered for the deal practically included everything on the regular menu, plus you could have lots of appetizers. Though in literal terms; There was a maximum item of 20 items per person, though I can't imagine how anyone could need more the 20 items of food. Also there is a fair warning that you will be charged $1 for every piece of  unfinished food, so if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, be prepared to pay. Gratuity is also included on the check.

Its BYOB and they gave our bottle of wine a nice, cozy, iced pail and good sized glasses.

Anyways, We started off with lots of appetizers, Fried Oysters, or Kaki Fry, Takoyaki.
Nori Soup, Aged tofu, Shumai and Bacon and Quail Egg Skewers. They all were really good, they came out nice and hot, maybe a little too hot. Small portions, but they all were very good and nicely presented. 

We each got a Sashimi Platter, though that was included in the all you can eat deal it was limited to 1 per person. However, it was very pretty and the sashimi was very pleasant and tasted fresh; don't ask me what kind of fish it was though, There was a  red and 2 white fleshed fish, 6 slices of fish in all.

Finally we got 3 specialty rolls. Dragon Roll, Ichiban, and Dallas, They were 8 pieces each and the put it on an awesome Japanese bridge shaped serving platter, it was so nice A bright blue lit glass decorated with rice noodles and a cherry flower on top, I'm sure I'm describing it crazy, but it was very pretty. In addition we had regular sushi  which were the Hokki clam, White tuna, and Smoked salmon. The regular sushi was 2pieces per order.  It was sooo much food. 

All in all a great experience, Pricey but we'll go back, and once again, It's Not closed.",2,"good"
