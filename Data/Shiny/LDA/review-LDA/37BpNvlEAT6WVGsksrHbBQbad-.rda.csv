"2","OK, a little background first; I'm a Southerner born and bred, not quite Redneck but have little use for fad food joints and yuppies.  I try not to go north of the Mason-Dixson  Line any more than I have to.  I can catch a Gulf Coast Amberjack, clean him, and  have him in the skillet in the blink of an eye.  I have both Tennessee limestone spring water and Gulf Coast salt water flowing in my veins.

So what do I think of some Yankees from Boston that think they can come down South and fry a piece of fish?  

Yes they can!

My yuppie nephew said I should try the place.

First impression was the high noise level.  Not good.  

Second impression was the two young Caucasian guys rolling Sushi (no kidding) in a place for FRIED fish.  Really not good.

I though to myself that this was just NOT going to work out.

I laughed at the thought of ordering oysters or mussels as I won't eat an oyster if I'm more than a hundred miles from Apalachicola.  And up til now, all the mussels I've tried in Nashville tasted like they walked from the bay on their own.

So I  played it safe and ordered the fish and fries.

It was GREAT!  The fish was a good sized portion and thick.  It had a wonderful, crispy crust, not that  crunchy corn meal southern batter but a light flour coating, probably double dipped. 

 It was fried to perfection, light and fluffy all the way through and piping hot.

The fries came in a paper bag and were a little mushy.  But to be honest, I had ignored them for the first 15 minutes and not even opened the bag to let them breath.

My son had some pasta dish with mussels which I thought was going to be a big mistake.  Due to the huge portion, he couldn't finish it which was good because his brother and I were stealing bites of it every chance we got.  I ended up eating four of those mussels.  

Don't know who the supplier is but they get them there fresh and Batter and Fried knows how to prepare them for the table.  The mussels were actually tender with a buttery, well seasoned finish.

The shrimp was OK for Nashville fare.  But remember, you're reading a review from a fellow that has off loaded his own from the boat and taken them straight to the kitchen.

I saw a platter of oysters at the next table and they looked tempting.

The servers were friendly and helpful.  Mine brought me a taste of the coconut sauce they have.  I never saw anything like that in a Boston fish house.  If that is what drives the Coconut Shrimp dish then I'm all for trying that one next time.

Nephew says seating is the trick to a quieter experience.  But I wasn't paying too much attention to the noise after that good food landed on the table.

It is a definite ""must return"" on our dinning list.

Heck, I'll even accessorize my bibbed overalls with a Boston Red Sox baseball cap.",1,"good"
"3","If you have a desire for some fried seafood, consider Batter'd & Fried as a good choice to find plenty of options to satisfy your hunger.  I went to B&F on a Sunday early evening for dinner.  Located in East Nashville, the restaurant is nice and cozy.  The staff is very welcoming once entering in the front door.  My boyfriend and I were ushered to a table near the back so we could watch some of the football game.  There is a bar area with televisions as well.  

There is a seafood menu and a sushi menu.  The sushi menu seemed interesting, especially with the mixed roll platters (which seem like an economically good deal for those wanting to try a variety of different sushi rolls).  Another reason to come back and try things from this menu...and also because they are apparently voted as best sushi in Nashville.

We decided to stick with the seafood menu.  Of the items that caught my eye from the appetizers list, such ceviche, crab cakes, calamari and mussels, we chose the mussels.  They did not disappoint.  The shells seemed super delicate (more so than usual). The mussels' broth was nice and savory and perfect to pair with the bread that it came with.   Next, our entrees...I chose the ""off the grill"" scallops, paired with mashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day (asparagus).  My boyfriend ordered ""off the grill"" tuna with mashed potatoes.  When the plates were presented, I was happy with my tasty scallops, which sat in a garlic butter sauce.  The mashed potatoes were very, very plentiful.  In fact, after a few spoonfuls, I decided to just box them up and take them home.  For reference, this one leftover served as a side of two people the next day...so, the point, I got a mountain full of potatoes.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, was not too happy with his tuna.  Looking at it, it seemed to look overcooked as it was advertised to be ""seared.""  I have had better looking seared tuna at food chains like Bonefish Grill.  He asked me if I wanted to try it, but I couldn't even bring myself to thinking that it would taste appetizing.  Also, they must measure it out in the kitchen because it barely even seemed like enough to satisfy hunger.  Our waitress, who was very attentive and responsive throughout the meal, came to our table and asked about the food and we did mention to her about the tuna.  The manager then appeared and stated that is how the tuna is prepared in their kitchen. Hmmm... well, have your chef google seared tuna and that it what all other kitchens are preparing. 

Other than the tuna, everything was good at B&F, from the service to the taste of the food.  I do want to go back to try the sushi and maybe some of the fried dishes.  I would also encourage others to give this place a try as well.",2,"good"
"4","I wish I could tell you about the food, but we couldn't get past the poor service to even enjoy a meal. I can't recall a worse experience at a restaurant.

Our visit started off with our friends taking us to this place while we were in town visiting.  There was a little bit of a wait and the hostess couldn't really give us an accurate wait time.  When we asked her opinion, she stated to us that she would not wait.  Wow-way to bring in the business.  When we decided to put our name down she became annoyed, as though her job just got a lot harder in order for her to print our name on the paper.   

There were six of us and two of us were pregnant.  The guys opted to stand near the door and us three girls found a table to sit at near the bar.  We asked if it was okay since there was a wait and the hostess said it was since nobody else was waiting to sit in that area.   The bar was crowded and a line of people stood even behind the bar stools watching the game. A waiter who was having to slide through the crowd came by and looked at the girl that was standing on the end of our table and said ""Can you move somewhere else?""   There was no please...no smile, no offer to take our non alcoholic drink order..no nothing. Just the request, and he walked off.    He didn't bother to ask any of the 20 men standing in the way to move over.  Okay, so they have some rude wait staff...Surely the food is worth the wait and the pathetic lack of customer service.

Our guys finally went to the bar and got us a few drinks (non alcoholic of course), dropped off the drinks at our table and then went back to stand out of the way.  The rude server then comes back and asks us if we would like to order something...OBVIOUSLY seeing our drinks and the fact that we had already been sitting there 20 minutes.  When we told him we got drinks from the bar, he threw his hands up and said ""PERFECT."" And again..walked away without saying anything else.  

About 15 minutes went by and we still didn't have a table, hadn't been spoken to by anyone else and continued to receive the evil eye from the rude waiter each time he walked by and had to turn sideways to get by.  We then decided to leave when an Asian looking manager came up to the table beside us to clean it off. I told him I""d like to discuss the lack of customer service we had received at the restaurant and he seemed annoyed right off and continued to wipe the table without so much as some eye contact.  After I told him that the hostess informed us that she would not in fact wait to eat here..he looked at me in disbelief as though I was lying and put his hands up and said ""Really, no why would she do that?""  I started to go into detail about the rude waiter but he continued to have this look on his face like he didn't care so we just got our belongings and left.   Again...no customer service when he was about to lose 6 customers...no asking us to wait a moment to see if he could rectify the problem, no apologies..  Wow.  I was in disbelief..how do you run a business like that?

Needless to say none of us or our friends have been back.",1,"bad"
"5","My hubby & I ate here for lunch on a Monday. The place was pretty crowded when we walked in so I thought, ""the food must be really good""!  We were seated right away but we got put at a 2 person table. Normally this isn't a problem but the table was soooo small. There wasn't much room to put the food and it was making me feel uncomfortable so I asked if we could move to a bigger table once the crowd died down. Server was nice & accommodated us. 

The atmosphere of the place was full of Red Sox stuff on the walls. One side of the place was the bar area, which looked like the kind of place I wouldn't mind hanging out with a couple of friends. The place overall was clean, average size, very casual. 

Server came & took our drink order & food order in a timely fashion. The menu itself was a good amount of choices. And I love Sushi so that was a nice addition to have a good size sushi menu also. Although,  as someone mentioned in another review a ""gaijin"" is making the sushi. I didn't try any there but saw an order come by for another table. The sushi looked good & a generous size portion on the rolls. Wish I would have tried one. 

We ordered the Ceviche appetizer. It's made with crab meat, cilantro, tomatoes, onions & peppers, sliced avocado on top and tortilla chips on the side. I have had Ceviche all over, especially in the Carribbean. This tasted different, not like the ceviche I'm used to so maybe this is more of a East-Coast Boston? type Ceviche. Maybe this is how it's traditionally made there. But just so you know it is different, a different flavor profile. I didn't taste lime juice...if it had it, there wasn't nowhere near enough in it for a ceviche. The taste was good, ok, but not anything special and for the $9.99 price tag, I was a bit disgusted that it was just ok & that the portion was not very big. For that price I expected a huge plate full for us to share. I know crab is an expensive ingredient but still I think this was overpriced for what it was.  If we go back I would pass on that.   

Oh and another thing I wanted to mention about the menu was that they had NO lunch specials! They had a couple of specials on the sushi rolls but no lunch portioned/cheaper specials on the dinners. Everything is pricey on their menu too, compared to other seafood restaurants who have similar items. And especially for such a casual restaurant. Our lunch was $50 for 2 people. We both had water, 1 appetizer, & 2 entrees. 
Most working people can't afford to spend that kind of money on lunch!  Or not very often anyway. This place could do more business I'm sure if they had lunch specials. 

Back to the food. My hubby ordered the seafood platter- $16.99.  It had  a piece of fish, clams, scallop, oysters, & shrimp, fries & slaw. The fried seafood has a nice crispy coating.  My husband said it was all ok. We've been to a lot of very good seafood restaurants so we don't go overboard if the food is just average. 

My dinner was the Atlantic Whole Belly Clams- $16.99. It was an 8 oz. portion of the whole belly clams, cole slaw & fries. I had never seen the whole belly clams on a menu anywhere near here. This is a specialty up North on the East coast too. I saw them talked about on a food tv show & they raved about how much better they were than just regular clams. 

They tasted like an oyster, more juicy like one. But I think my order was over cooked so the clams were a bit too chewy & not as tender as I expected them to be. Slaw was good, fries were good. 

The sauces that came with both platters were ok but they were both homemade. . ""The tarter  was homemade but looked like a creamy mayo with not much else in it. The cocktail sauce almost reminded me of a marinara sauce, a bit chunky and the taste was so so,. They had way too much pepper in that sauce. Oh & all the seafood, sauces, and even the chips with the ceviche was FULL of salt! Now, I like salt a lot & use it on just about everything so for me to say it's heavily salted than wow, it was on the verge on not being edible.

So with all that said, this place is an average seafood restaurant but with big prices. Should you go out of your way to visit it, no. If you have the money to splurge on an expensive seafood dinner, this isn't the place either.

 So disappointed...it really COULD be a great place. Improve the food by getting a better chef! Add lunch specials and/or dinner specials.",2,"bad"
