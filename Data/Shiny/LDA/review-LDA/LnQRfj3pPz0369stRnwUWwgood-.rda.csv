"2","I'm cruising through Brandon with my bass banging high, I got a couple of mommas riding right by my side. Two babies in the back looking for chow, stop at Taqueria Dona Maria ready to eat right now. All five of us march in without much fan fare, the waitress informs us ""You'll have to wait, we are all out of high chairs"" (record scratch)...

Say what? Only two high chairs in the whole place and they are both being used? Sorry, we gotta bolt.

The five of us dejectedly took some selfies and then piled back into the car. Our new dinner destination, thanks to Yelp and their hot and new designation, was Sushi Uchi. 

Sushi Uchi is a nearly two month old sushi restaurant located in a strip mall in Valrico. I inquired about high chairs before bringing everyone in and they assured me they had plenty (they also gave me a strange look as if to say how many babies are you trying to bring into this place). We were seated at a table for five in the middle of the dimly lit restaurant and handed menus. One of the first things we noticed? Sushi Uchi serves the avocado and peanut roll we are always on the look out for. Score! They also had our old stand-by the Tempura Sweet Potato Roll. We ordered one of each roll, a side of rice for the little one and a bowl of miso soup. The other mommy and child also ordered a side or rice and the tempura sweet potato roll. They added a Mexican roll to their order.

First to arrive were our sides of rice and the miso soup. There was nothing unique or fancy about the soup, it was pretty much the same version of miso soup I've had at hundreds of other sushi places across the United States. The side of rice was, well, a side of rice. Hard to mess that up.

Next out was the sushi rolls. The presentation of the rolls was very pretty. They were served on a long, white platter. The peanut and avocado roll was lined up in two rows of four and stood on end. The tempura sweet potato roll was laid down on top of a leaf, and drizzled with a sweet sauce. At the end of the platter there was a dollop of wasabi and some pickled ginger (all for show because we don't mess with that stuff). My first bite was of the avocado and peanut roll. Unlike Aya, the first place we had it, this roll didn't include sweetened peanuts. These were of the salted variety. I really liked the combination of creamy avocado and crunchy, salty peanut. J-Fur wasn't quite as impressed as she desired the sweeter version. The Tempura Sweet Potato Roll was great. It was perfectly crisped, warm, and only slightly sweet. I was a huge fan of both rolls. 

After all the platters had been cleaned, our dinner guest and J-Fur stared at each other for a few seconds sizing up what to do next. Finally J-Fur spoke and said ""I want another Tempura Sweet Potato Roll."" Our guest smiled and said that she was just thinking the same thing. So they both got another one. When the customers clamor for more, that's when you know it's good.

The wait staff here was super attentive and helped out with every request we made. They even took the time to make faces at the little ones and play a bit. I'm not in Valrico much but next time I return, Sushi Uchi will be my food destination choice.",1,"good"
"3","It's time to update my review. I previously gave them 4 stars but after yesterday's visit it is now 5 stars. I've always loved their sushi creations but I'd never tried their ramen. The tonkotsu ramen was truly wonderful. So much so that I can't decide which restaurant makes it better because I like all the ones I've had nearby. They all have their unique qualities. But this one had thick slices of pork belly that couldn't go without an honorable mention. They also had the seasoned egg which I love. The broth to noodle ratio was very good, and that broth was so tasty. I just feel so fortunate to have so many options close by now. 

So, I was told that the ramen used to only be on a daily specials menu. Now they offer it all day long. At lunch, it comes with their house salad and ginger dressing. The ginger dressing has always been great. I also couldn't leave without trying the Ceviche Roll which I don't remember seeing on the menu back in 2017. It was exactly how I envisioned it to be. All fish and no rice. It had the freshest tuna, salmon, and yellowtail ever. I mean it was so soft that it almost melted in my mouth. Like buttah (butter)! The avocado was just as fresh and beautiful. Not a single brown blemish. All of it wrapped in rice paper and served with a wasabi yuzu sauce which was very light. It was perfect! I'd get this one again. I also like the Out of Control Roll, Sashimi Roll, and Dragon Roll. All are great choices, but do look at their daily sushi specials as you walk in. They have chef special creations daily such as an omakase apetizer, striped bass, uni, torched salmon belly, and the list goes on. Just check out the daily posts on their Facebook page. I'm craving sushi right now just thinking about that Ceviche Roll.

Besides sushi, they have all kinds of noodle bowls too. I see 4 different soba preparations, chicken or shrimp udon, and tonkotsu or spicy miso ramen. I've had ramen and udon but not soba yet. So I'll have to go back and try that (Thanks a lot, Craig K). Also the service is fantastic, and the Thai tea is awesome. They already have a local following.  What more can I say? Just try it.",2,"good"
