"2","I looked at other peoples reviews that were negative about Zen Bistro and I am a little shocked.  My first time dining here was last weekend and we had an overall pleasant experience.  Of course, I don't have the historical context of having been there multiple times in the past but maybe they got a new front of house manager or someone that this pulling the place back on track? 

Anyway, the food was pretty fantastic.  We ordered a bunch or appetizers to start, with my favorite being the vegetable tempura and the beef satay a close second.  I ordered my two usual rolls: bagel roll and spice tuna roll, both of which were well done.  When it comes to sushi, I am pretty particular and I typically prefer a very thin layer of rice around the seaweed, they got very close to perfect on this.  Personally, there is no worse feeling than shoving a huge rice-ball-piece-of-sushi into your mouth inhibiting you from tasting the fish or other ingredients inside... ...but that might just be a personal preference :) 

I enjoyed the ambiance as it was pretty disarming and relaxing.  Lower dimmed lighting and a back lit tree trunk wall feature added a nice touch and texture to the wall. 

Service was not bad, nor was it amazingly punctual or mind blowing.  My rating is based on the food and decor alone.  Cheers!",1,"good"
"3","I'm going 4.5 star on this one, folks!  I've eaten here a lot and nothing was off center; not the food, the service or atmosphere. 

Items I recommend: VOLCANO ROLL - best in town!  Serious.  I eat this roll everywhere I go.  COCONUT CURRY BEEF STEW - traditional beef stew in a beef stock gravy and a hint of coconut curry?  Are you serious?  This is one of the best fusion ideas I've seen to date.  It's served with some very fresh French bread, but order a side of rice and throw it in your bowl.  You won't be sad about this decision.  HONEY WALNUT ROCK SHRIMP - some of the meatiest shrimp I've ever seen.  Very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Then it's glazed with a wonderful honey sauce and topped with walnuts.  Look, I don't even LIKE walnut, and I found this dish to be nothing but amazing.  Never mind the fact that it's served with melon scoops and rice.  MISO SOUP - bangin'!  Better than I've had at most Japanese restaurants.  True story.  CURRIED CRAB DUMPLING - curried crab, cream cheese, minced raisins and cilantro wrapped in gyoza skins and fried until crispy served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  I mean, how much stuff can they shove into these things?  Just straight up DELICIOUS!

Ask for Marcella, she's the bee's knees.  I always look forward to my next visit for some House music and Asian-influenced grub!",2,"good"
"4","Might have to be done with this place after the latest experience.  As we walked in we were told they were busy but we could sit outside so went with that.  After placing our drink and app order we started to be attacked by mosquitoes.  We asked if we could move inside but were told they were slammed.  We were offered bug spray and opted for that.  Went in to wash our hands after slathering on said bug spray and noticed a number of tables open.  So we can sit outside with mosquitoes and get served but the same server can't help us inside?  Service was extremely slow.  After waiting forever had to walk in to try and get someone to run my card.  Someone sitting at the bar said they could help me and took my bill (I always love employees hanging out at the bar).  Was also nice to notice almost half of the tables were still empty.  The food was ok but nothing spectacular, which seems to be the case each time.  Drinks were mixed.  One good and one not so good.  If we just looked at food and drinks we'd be ok with Zen but when you factor in service and price ($90+ for  dinner for 2) we'd have to pass.  So we left tonight lighter in the wallet but gained a few new bug bites and the lovely smell of bug spray (always nice to need a shower after going to dinner).  Zen has always been the place we want to like but it never delivered.  We enjoy the trendy atmosphere and DJ but unfortunately it falls short on food and service, which is needed in a restaurant.  I'll note that we're not sushi people and a number of reviews talk about sushi.  So this might be the area they excel at but is lost on us.  I feel like the owner wants to own a trendy club/bar more than a restaurant.",1,"bad"
"5","I really, really can't believe I have to give it one star, but I do.  I've ordered takeout from here many times and the food is always good. I decided to have my birthday celebration there with some friends. The staff kind of ruined it.

First, I called a few days in advance to make the reservation. We weren't sure how many people were coming, so we rounded up to be safe. I asked for a reservation for 14. The woman on the phone was very short with me, she said ""Yeah - but you gotta sit outside.""  I was caught off guard and asked her what she meant. She said since we had over ten people, their policy was to seat parties over ten on the patio. She assured me that there were heaters, and it was covered and very nice. 

We arrived right on time, there ended up being ten of us. We stood at the hostess station for a good five minutes while servers and hostesses ignored us. Finally I caught someone's attention who told us to ""go ahead and sit down outside.""  No servers came by to check on us. One girl from our party went inside to order a drink from the bar, where a bartender spilled warm Sake all over her. She was not offered anything in the way of an apology.

After about thirty minutes of sitting and waiting outside, we still had no server. Finally we flagged someone down, who sent our server out. Her excuse was that ""she was waiting for everyone else to get here,"" and it was ""really rude of them to be so late."" I explained that we were not waiting on anyone else, but that I had overestimated in making the reservations. Again, she did not apologize for making us wait. 

The service was extremely slow. I don't know if they kept forgetting about us because we were outside, or perhaps they had a lot of to go orders that night as the restaurant did not appear busy. Also, no matter how many times we asked, the ""heaters"" that the woman on the phone had told me about were not turned on. It was about fifty degrees out, which is far too cold to be outside with no heat. 

The food was good, no complaints there. But the night was pretty miserable - everyone was freezing and tired of waiting.",2,"bad"
