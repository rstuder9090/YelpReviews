"2","If I were reviewing strictly on quality of food alone I would hands down give the sushi here a solid 5 stars. All of the rolls we ordered were very fresh, decently sized, fair ratio of fish to rice and flavorful and creative combinations.  
Ordered the J-Bomb for an app. It was very good, but is small. Its only 2 pieces so hard to share. 
Ordered the Kill Bill, Romeo & Juliet, Samurai, Firebird, and the Del Mar. Each one was distinctively different than the rest. My favorite probably Kill Bill or Samurai. Firebird was probably my least favorite. I really prefer the taste of raw salmon over cooked. It had a very distinct smoky flavor.

If I were reviewing strictly on customer service I would give my experience a 1. It really was that bad.  We had reservations ( which really weren't necessary as the place was very slow the whole time we were there) and yet they seemed to be ill prepared to handle our group.

A very unreasonable time passed before we were ever greeted, compounded with even longer to get something to drink, and almost no chance of a refill. The ordering system of filling out your own menu cards for a sushi order proved disastrous. Picture 5 couples each with 4-5 rolls per order card trying to decipher who's roll was who's when they started coming out. Even our waiter seemed to struggle with keeping track of who had what.
Overall there seemed to be serious lack of urgency in service; like we kept getting forgotten about when I'm almost positive we were the only table assigned. It was so odd. It got to the point when all we could do was just joke about it and make the best of the situation.

I feel like a true fair rating would be a 3.5 stars. 3 seems too low, because the sushi was that good. And a 4 seems too high given the ridiculous service. So what to do?!? I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and hoping there was some kind of random reason the service was lacking that night.

Thinking it would be worth the 10% up charge to order the food to go, to eliminate the need to chance bad service again. Which honestly I don't understand why you would charge more to someone ordering takeout?? But I digress.....",1,"good"
"3","I just moved into a neighborhood right down the road from Wasabi. I went here last Thursday and found myself back for dinner on Saturday night. Seeing as though I try not to eat out very often, that makes this quite the exception.

Let me start with the sushi itself. I ordered a sampling of the nigiri and tried the salmon, yellowtail, albacore, white tuna, scallops. The cuts of fish were large, fresh, and very tasty. Some places tend to overdo it on the rice portion of nigiri--Wasabi nails it. They have a smaller portion of rice so you're able to better taste the fish. That being said, the rice itself is seasoned perfectly; just a touch sweet, with that nice hint of rice vinegar. Every piece of nigiri I tried was terrific. The rolls are large, plated well, and priced affordably.

The service, too, is terrific. I have gotten accustomed to waiting ~30-45 minutes from time of order until food begins arriving at my table. It wasn't more than 10 minutes or so from time of order for the food to arrive. The servers are pleasant, quick, and attentive. It bespeaks a well-staffed establishment that the food comes out in a timely manner and it's never hard to get the attention of a server. Even though I have not seen more than 2 servers nor 3 chefs behind the sushi bar, this level of service is maintained. Every table gets their food promptly and even when it looks like it's filling up, the level of service is maintained.

The decor is pretty subdued here. All of the windows are covered by wood paneling so there's no headlights shining in while you're trying to enjoy a bite, and when it's night you don't feel like you're in a fish bowl. 

I really like this restaurant and am happy it's my neighborhood sushi joint.",2,"good"
