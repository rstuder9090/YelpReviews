"2","Wow just wow at all the food!  Actually a bit overwhelmed by all the options -- probably 5 different kinds of rice and then the various meats.  I am so glad that I was with a group of people and not by myself to help me in deciding what to get.  I ended up getting the yellow rice with pork and wow was it yummy.  For $7.99 the serving sizes are HUGE -- they definitely load you up on the food.  It was enough to feed 3 of us.  They also have all kinds of bakery items including flan and tres leche cakes -- which I did end up getting a tres leche cake and that was amazingly delicious as well.  I also got a bag of the fresh plantain chips for $1.79 and those were good -- needed a bit more salt but overall very fresh and delightful.  They do have seating available both inside and outside, the restaurant was very busy and the line of people keep coming in during lunch primetime.  Recommend if you want some good latino food for relatively cheap.  The place is very clean and staff is very friendly.  I saw that they also have breakfast available as well as smoothies and caf√© con leche",1,"good"
"3","As a Cuban American born and raised in Miami I have been searching for an authentic Cuban ""cafeteria"" style restaurant since I moved to Tampa 7 years ago. 

7 years. That's how long it took for me to find Maikel's Kitchen. Since I stumbled upon Maikel's Kitchen two weeks ago I must have eaten here about 10 times, and each time I have dragged a friend or friends to eat this God-sent food that has been cooked with abuela (grandmother) like-love. 

I have had all the types of rice, the ropa Vieja (pulled beef), the bbq pork ribs, picadillo (ground beef), the Cuban sandwich, media noche (midnight) sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, steak sandwich, smoothies, and their Cuban style pastries. 


Let me be the first, and most bold, to say that Maikel's Kitchen has the VERY BEST Cuban Sandwich in ALL of Tampa Bay (yes, better than West Tampa Sandwich and Bodega). The folks claiming the Cuban was not good, also described a Cuban sandwich that was not authentic. Therefore, what they were looking for is not a Cuban sandwich. 

Everything about Maikel's Kitchen is authentic. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out. 

Not only is the food AMAZING, but the prices are unbeatable. A Cuban sandwich goes for $4 and change, and a full meal will not run you more than $15 and will be enough to split with someone else or save for later (I can EAT, and I can't ever finish the meal on my own.) 



Anyway, I'm so excited they are here and hope they are here to stay. They are now running with the best Cuban Food Crown. 

Pictures to come.
