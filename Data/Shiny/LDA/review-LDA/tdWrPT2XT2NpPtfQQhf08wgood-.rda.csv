"2","We came here on a Thursday night for the all-you-can-eat sushi. Some of the other reviews on Yelp were a bit worrying, but everything was very good, especially considering the very reasonable price, and we'll definitely be back.

The AYCE sushi is made-to-order rather than a buffet, and the menu includes sashimi, nigiri, regular rolls, and fancy rolls. There's also a kitchen menu - we ordered only miso soup, but there were other items available as well.

The standard rolls and nigiri are exactly what you'd expect. One highlight was the mango and avocado roll, which turned out to be one of my favorite items that night.

The specialty rolls were good. Not great, but solidly good and very satisfying, well-balanced, and not too heavy on rice. One note - not all of the specialty rolls on the restaurant menu are available for AYCE. The AYCE rolls seem to be mainly limited to those filled with spicy tuna/salmon/etc. or tempura. But they're often topped with real slabs of fish, so I can't complain.

The sashimi, as other reviewers have said, really is cut super thin, but it was still quality fish. So it wasn't bad, really, just sort of silly.

So while this place is nowhere near as amazing as Blue Fin, it's still a good meal at half the price, and you don't need a reservation weeks in advance.",1,"good"
"3","Very very solid experience every time. I fancy their sushi rolls but the fancier ones. their hand rolls are delicious. The hand rolled spider roll is my favorite along with the hand rolled oyster roll. The pink lady is another favorite in our household. I don't think I've ever had anything other than their Japanese cuisine but the place is usually packed and everybody seems happy. The miso soup is to die for. I know that sounds strange because it's such a basic thing but I could literally eat that stuff by the quart and I order a quart every time I'm there.

So if you want some good food for a decent price go see my friends at Jasmine Asian House and oh yeah tell 'em big Texas sent you.",2,"good"
