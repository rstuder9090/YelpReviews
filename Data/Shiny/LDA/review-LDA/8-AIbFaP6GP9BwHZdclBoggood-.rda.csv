"2","I have to say that I was quite surprised by this little restaurant in areas of price and atmosphere.  With the beautiful art and presentation of the food, I was happy to be dining there when my restaurant of choice was closed unexpectedly.  Would I be a regular here... jury's out.

Atmosphere:
Located in the center of a strip mall, Oh Yoko! is rather unassuming.  The restaurant is decorated as though it could almost double as an art gallery.  The gorgeous paintings on the wall (done by the owner's niece and son) and the dimmer lighting made this a great restaurant to bring friends who prefer the trendy-type dining.  There are bits here and there of Beatles Memorabilia and Def of Yoko Ono throughout.  They pump Beatles songs throughout the restaurant (how could anyone complain?)  

Food:
We ordered 3 different types of rolls, Sashimi (salmon only), soup and shu mai and given edamame (tasted fine) for free because the food was taking so long to come out and dessert

The Rolls
The rolls were done with the right balance of rice to main ingredients.  The rice was not SMASHED into the nori (most Japanese places make this mistake. - perhaps because most Japanese restaurants are not run by Japanese people around here..) and the roll were tight and given angular cuts which only added to the presentation (and nice plates)

The Sashimi
The sashimi was obviously fresh...  they gave me the center cuts and also a few belly cuts (more fatty pieces).  I am not a huge fan of the fattier pieces of salmon, but they seemed to think that they were giving me some of the best cuts  (not sure what to think about this as these are not considered the ideal pieces because of meat:fat balance) I also ordered a side of brown rice (came with green tea powder sprinkled on top - nice touch)
 It came in an ICE bowl - that made the presentation amazing.

Soup:
Miso - the soup was made using the red miso (I believe, the lighting was rather dim) or a mixture of white and red miso -which made it actually taste much stronger than I have normally experienced.  The beauty of miso is the delicate miso flavor (from white miso) which is less pungent than the red. Still good though..

Shu Mai (Shrimp)
The shu mai tasted great (as all shrimp shu mai does), but I could not tell whether or not it was frozen or fresh - it seemed like it was homemade.

SOY SAUCE:
They home brew their own.. it has a slight sweet flavor and is very good if you have a sweet tooth.

Dessert:
Green Tea & Vanilla ice cream with Tempura fried bananas.  Normally it comes with your choice of vanilla OR green tea ice cream.. (we requested both).  It was Excellent - but then again, how can you miss on a fried banana?


The service:
We were never RUSHED during our meal, but dinner turned out to be almost 2 hours long (1 hour 45min?)  ..and not because we wanted it that way.
The server, she was very sweet, however, she did forget to refill my green tea for a long while and the food took a VERY long time to come out.

For the delay in service, she gave us complimentary edamame though (nice touch)


Prices:
The prices were rather high. Most sushi restaurants usually provide 2 pieces per order (generally around $4) for sashimi, but this place charged by the piece and Salmon was $3.50 for 1 piece.  Some of the common rolls like Dragon (eel, avocado, cucumber)  was around $14 - to me, that is a bit much - but you may be paying for the atmosphere, experience and presentation.


Overall:

The food was good, presentation was great, atmosphere was cozy/eclectic, and service was great and average at the same time ...

"3","So I was in the area for business last week and decided to get some sushi Thursday for lunch.  Looking at the options in the area, I picked this one... partially from review quality, partially from random selection, and partially due to being intrigued by the name of the business.  (I think that names can tell you everything about Japanese restaurants, but that's a topic for another review)

Anyway... getting there it was a small store in a random strip mall.  I entered, and was somewhat surprised: not a single other patron in the store.  I thought, as it was 11:30am that perhaps I was just early for lunch, but I was there for a little less than an hour and even when I finished no one else was there.  As you might imagine from the name: there's some album covers and memorabilia of the Beatles on the wall.  The staff had been sitting down but when I came in they got up, went to the back, and turned on some music, also the Beatles.  

A Korean husband and wife team ran the shop: him making sushi and her waitressing.  She was nice enough though did not seem very interested in her job, and went back to sitting down after serving my food .

I got the sushi and sashimi lunch.  The prices are... well, slightly pricey.  Not the most expensive sushi I've had in my life but the lunch prices were all well over $15.  It came with a choice of mushroom or miso soup and as I have an aversion to most storemade (prepackaged) miso soup I went with the mushroom, which was a pretty decent if non-traditional choice.  The broth was pretty rich tasting and had some fresh sliced mushrooms on top, then a thin layer of sesame oil (maybe a bit much as it ended up being slightly oily, but it wasn't a bad soup) and some kind of spicy element.

Then the food came out on a lacquered/bento-box style platter.  They actually had fresh wasabi, which came as a surprise to me.  The waitress gave out instructions (i.e. don't put wasabi in the soy sauce put it directly on your fish, don't put the ginger in your soy sauce, etc.) which always amuse me, and then left me to my food.  There were 5 fat slices of sashimi, 5 really very perfectly made nigiri, a salad in a ponzu vinaigrette (a nice change from the ubiquitous orange ginger dressing), a cold Korean inspired noodle salad of somen type thin noodles and sliced cabbage in a sesame tasting dressing, and sliced fresh persimmon, which was a nice touch.  The noodle salad was just average but both the persimmon and spinach salad were good.

The sushi itself: I found the fish to be extremely high quality.  The sashimi included a piece each of squid, salmon, tuna, escolar, and something that isn't coming to mind right now, while the sushi were mackarel, tuna, eel,  a white fish like flounder, and yellowtail.  Each piece was excellently handled: for example the eel itself had that crispiness saying it was expertly hand broiled with a torch or something instead of just normally cooked and served.  For whatever reason, there was a dollop of gold leaf on the tuna but that's not really here nor there.

Anyway, all in all I found it a bit expensive but good enough.  I was also slightly irked at being charged for a small iron pot of watery tea.  I've noticed that often non-Japanese owned businesses tend to nickle-and-dime you for the things that would be a given at a Japanese restaurant (hot tea, rice if you're having sashimi, etc.) although I'm certainly aware that this could just be my perception.",2,"good"
