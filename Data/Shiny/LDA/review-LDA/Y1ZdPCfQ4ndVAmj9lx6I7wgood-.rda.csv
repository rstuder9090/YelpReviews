"2","We went there during our travel to Tucson. It was after a day of intensive hiking, so we decide to try this buffet. I would say that the buffet is worth the price. There are a lot of choices for people with different preference. The food is yummy and I love their mushrooms.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I are traveling in AZ. We both like buffet and planning to travel this restaurant. When I first came inside, the area is clean and tide. There are several kinds of food which always hot and full. I love sushi and their sushi are really good. The salmon and avocados are fresh and the soups are tasty. The price is affordable. The waitresses are nice and talks our plates away fast and always come to refill our drinks. We would come again if we get another chances.",2,"good"
