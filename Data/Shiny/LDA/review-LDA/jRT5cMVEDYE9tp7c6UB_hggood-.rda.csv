"2","It's not often as a yelper that I go to check in at one of our favorite spots, and find that other yelpers have obviously not discovered a place.

If you are a Franklin resident or not, you need to check out this adorable little Chinese place that is in the posh Westhaven subdivision west of Franklin proper, out Highway 96.

Ching's isn't a big place, I think there's only about 15 tables in the whole place.  It's family owned, and as you look around you might wonder why one wall is papered in a feminine oriental tea pattern, and the other is a darker copper accented Chinese letter pattern.  Like often happens in marriages, that's because the husband and wife owners couldn't agree, so they picked both.

This is NOT a buffet Chinese restaurant, you are seated and order your entree of choice that comes on a larger plate ideal for shaing and your choice of fried or white rice.  They have all the usuals you are probably expecting:  Cashew Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, Seafood Delight... and whatever you choose, your order if prepared fresh just for you.  It's very reasonably priced, the Cashew Chicken that I enjoyed Saturday is like $8.95, hubby's Beef and Broccoli is like $9.95.  Beer and wine are offered, and they have good wonton soup for a starter or our favorite, crab rangoons.  I know, it's really cream cheese with a touch of crab rolled in a dumpling they fry... unhealthy by any accounts, but delicious so I don't care.

It's a neighborhood kind of place, tons of to-go orders stream in and out from Westhaveners enjoying life and grabbing a quick dinner.  The servers are nice, young folks for the most part that all speak English, many appear to be many folks from Westhaven and not Asian at all.

Ching's isn't an overly remarkable place, except for the fact that Cool Springs in all its splendor really doesn't have a good non-buffet Chinese place that isn't a Japenese hibachi type of P.F. Chang's.  I love the smaller, independently owned shops, and this one is just our style.  You can use chopsticks, you can use a fork - no judgement.

If you visit on a pretty weekend day, Westhaven does have a pond out front of this portion of the strip shopping center where they rent canoes and paddleboats.  If you haven't toured Westhaven at all, please do and drive thry admiring the great houses, commons areas and parks.  And yes, the developer who created Seaside, Florida of ""Truman Show"" fame did develop Westhaven... and it's just as cute as you imagine.

Word to visitors from areas other than Franklin, pay close attention to speed limits on Highway 96 venturing out of Franklin to here.  Franklin Police are serious, and this is a favorite area for ticketing.  But other than that, do visit!",1,"good"
"3","4 Stars for food and subtracting one star for lack of service.  We were there on a busy night and I think all the employees were either stressed or extra tired.  Don't expect smiley friendly welcoming service, but the food makes up for the lack.  They weren't rude, although they all seemed unhappy.  It was probably a long day.  The young waiter who served us needed a bit more training.  We had to ask to give our order, we had to ask for a refill, we had to ask for to go boxes.  He quickly brought our check and fortune cookies, while I was still eating.  All of the empty dishes remained on our table.  

The food is what we will be back for and hopefully on a better night.  We ordered Cashew Prawns with Vegetables, Honey Glazed Chicken, Beef Steak and Vegetables, and Egg Rolls which were all A+ quite delicious!  We also ordered Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Lo-Mein which were both pretty good.  

It's in a nice little strip mall, on the outskirts of Franklin, although worth the 30 minute drive from Nashville.  The restaurant is very small, however it's nicely decorated.  It seemed to get extremely busy around 6:30.   I'm not sure if it was just an unusually busy night.

Bottom Line:  great food, we will be back!",2,"good"
