Besides Sakana in Hamilton, NJ, which unfortunately because of a fire, doesn't seem like it will open any time soon, Sakura is the best AYCE Sushi Restaurant in PA, NJ, DE, or anywhere else for that matter.

Too many people do not know what they are missing out on. 
The selection and quality of the rolls, nigiri, and sashimi are second to none, except Sakana.

Their servers are also a lot friendlier than the majority of the AYCE restaurants in the tri-state area.

The appetizers are delicious, the hot food is delicious, the sushi is delicious, and their ice cream which is only available for dinner, and only 1 scoop per person is delicious as well. 

I wish I could give it a perfect 5 stars, but there are a few glaring problems. 

#1 They already raised the price during COVID so that should be enough. 
The raised prices were $25.95 on weeknights and $26.95 on weekends, but they have now made every night $26.95

#2 For the price, the ice cream should be unlimited too, but you can only have 1 scoop each, and it's only available for dinner, not lunch.

#3 This is the worst one. So they limit you to only 50 pieces of sashimi per person, which is fine. I can live it with it, because all of the other food is delicious.
BUT, the chefs NEVER give you what you order.
For example, I order 20 pieces of yellowtail sashimi, then they give me 8 pieces. I order 15 pieces of eel sashimi, they get me 7 pieces. This happens all the time, with every order I put in. Even with the sushi, I had to order Ikura Sushi FOUR times before I finally got any Ikura!!!!!

If the limit is 50 pieces per person, then they should give the customer what they ordered. This is the most annoying part about this restaurant, because then you have to keep track of what you ordered, because they can say you ordered your 50 pieces of sashimi, when in reality, you only received 30 pieces. Because they charge you for every piece of sashimi that you order over 50 pieces!

Besides this stupidity on their part, Sakura blows Masa, Sushi Kingdom, Sushi Palace, Mr Sushi, Sushi King, Oki, Nagomi, and the rest of the AYCE restaurants out of the water. That is how good the food is. The other restaurants, except for Sakana have no chance in regards to their quality and selection.

I really wish they would address the 3 problems that I mentioned, especially the ordering problem. Then they would be a perfect 5 stars!",1,"good"
"3","Decided on a roommate dinner here scrolling thru the always trusty Yelp to find a place to eat. 

Heading here for some All You Can Eat Sushi, we stopped in for the dinner selection of hot items like BBQ Squid and fried Shui Mai along with rolls like eel based rolls with spicy tuna and crab meat along with the typical standard rolls that you'll find when you are craving. Their different salads were leaving wanting more. They had their standard seaweed salad but their crab salad was pretty much sticks of crab meat with pieces of red clam which was interesting. I would have preferred it to be shredded but the clam was a nice addition. 

My pull was the sashimi which came out pretty fresh. We ordered our salmon, red snapper, eel and white tuna. We also ordered scallop but that was a little more of a bust as they were formed well and ended up deflating a little. They had some items off a limited section per person per table like a white tuna martini which didn't come out in a martini glass like i assumed but it was good regardless. 

A little bummed that there wasn't dessert included in the meal that is pretty typical of other similar establishments.

The decor was modern with a bar area completed with TV that could be watched from our table and I imagine the bar top. They seem to have private spaces for larger parties too.",2,"good"
