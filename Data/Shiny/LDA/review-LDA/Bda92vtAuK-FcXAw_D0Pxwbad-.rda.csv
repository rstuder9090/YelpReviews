"2","Where else can you get unlimited sushi & Hibachi at a legit asian restaurant that is not a typical rundown buffet that might kill you due to grease and food poisoning?????? Nit Koizi!!! Oh and yeah.... of you're a Floridian/tampa bay resident...... DEF APPRECIATE!!!!! The fact we are the lucky ones to have this type of establishment in the Bay Area bc theres no other place or restaurant that offers this type of service and the selections of food across the state of country! Here's what i mean.... if you ever decided to go for a endless meal aka buffet style but not having to standup and pick your food then this is the place to GO. Yes, your traditional would be the cheap/nasty taste of rundown china buffet table with the same exact crap you would fine at a buffet style restaurant. Not with Koizi!! Not only do you have the luxury to order off the menu for your food but they cook it from the back and bring it to you. Now, the tradeoff is.. if you don't finish your order... they will charge you unless if its not a protein item. Oh btw, if you want to get fancy and step up the quality of their food... you can get a teppanyaki/hibachi grill table too! And no reservations needed unless you're celebrating with a large group. Comprendai?!?! Your typical hibachi grill has a set menu to pay and its pretty expensive plus no option to get certain food endless(Sushi/meal.. well with Koizi.. the same exact menu where you can get endless food (sushi & meat) endlessly!!! Yrs and they freakin grill it with your rice/veggie... which btw everything taste better on the hibachi grill. Not its a onetime grill from the hibachi grill.. but thats all you need for your meat. And yess.. even the traditional apps and entree of chinese foods are unlimited. Not from a buffet table you typically walk to get from. So yeah, tampa, clearwater, NPR... appreciate and love the ideal of having this unique kind of restaurant where you can get better quality food that is endless and able to get hibachi table grill too with the endless meal menu. Don't hate! Just own it fool!!!! Cuz no hibachi restaurant will offer or come close to what koizi offer...unless you like the cheap/trashy style buffet. Oh yeah, sushi is great! But the steak & shrimp on the tableside grill...... wowwww weeee Yummy!! Its the best taste wuality shrimp you'll ever find for a low cost endless meal. Under $20 dinner price baaaaay baaaay!!",1,"good"
"3","This has got to be the best Hibachi Restaurant my husband and I have ever experienced!  I made reservations for Our 5 year Wedding Anniversary.  I wanted something exciting and special.  Thats exactly what we got!  We were greated by the friendliest staff and an Amazing Hibachi Chef.  He entertained us with his culinary skills and the food was amazing.  Not salty or dried out, not even spicy.  We both got the Endless Hibachi Buffett for a very good price.  It included 2 choices of meats or seafood, soup or salad, a drink and even an appetizer.  Comes with fried rice, veggies and noodles. I also ordered a Sushi roll called the ""Yummy Yummy"" and it sure was.  I have never tasted Sushi so fresh it melted in your mouth.  The seaweed was fresh, crab was very chilled and cucumber nice and firm, along witg a creamy sauce and rolled in sticky rice with sesame seeds.  My husband was able to have a 2nd helping.  I couldn't.  I guarantee you will live it there and be so full after.  Great job guys, bucks very well spent here and we will definatly be back and with more people!",2,"good"
"4","So, we arrived at Koizi at 8pm on a Saturday and we were very pleasantly surprised that there were over a dozen tables in the dining room that were empty. We had previously visited the New Tampa location on a Saturday night around the same time and it was so crazy packed that the wait for a table was over an hour and a half! Anyway, as we looked around the restaurant, we noticed that there were over 6 empty seats at one of the 8 hibachi tables. So we thought that our party of 5 would have no problem getting seated at one of the hibachi tables. We did notice that only 3 of the 8 hibachi tables were actually in use. We were told by one of the 3 hostesses that were huddled behind the hostess counter that we would have to wait 15-20 min for a seat at a hibachi table. Umm, ok??? When we asked why we couldn't sit at the hibachi that had 6 empty seats one of the male waiters said ""I don't know why we are just told that the chefs don't want us to seat anyone there.""  When we asked to see a manager, a woman walked up to us but said nothing. WE actually had to ask her if she was the manager. She told us that she was filling in for the manager (Mike), who is on vacation. She actually manages the Brandon Koizi location. When we asked her why we couldn't be seated in the empty seats at the hibachi table she told us that the chefs request that no one sits at those seats because the walkway behind the seats isn't wide enough for their cooking cart to fit through. If that's the case then why even put chairs there then??? If you keep chairs there then you are constantly going to be questioned about why patrons aren't being seated there.   Another funny thing that we were told by the male waiter was that it would probably be an additional 15-20 min wait (beyond our original 15-20 min wait) before we could be seated because in his words ""the current customers were ""squatting"", and just hanging out talking at the table."" Wow! Not excusing his poor customer relations skills but given his age, it seems as if there hasn't been a lot of customer service/customer relations training yet provided to this young waiter. 
We were seated shortly after speaking with the Mgr. And again, the lack of customer relations skills of our waiter appeared as he passively-aggressively greeted us with this statement ""So, now that you are seated, are you better?"" Again, we let this go but hopefully someone from the Koizi mgmt team will read this review and address these issues. 
Our order was taken & our beverages were delivered to the table. Our starters were brought out quickly, with only one plate of sushi missing (vegetable rolls). Sushi, soups & salads were delicious! As we were enjoying our starters, our Chef came to the table & began his show. He was AMAZING! Very social, very entertaining & very talented! There were two small children in a separate party also seated at our table & our chef really make huge efforts to engage & entertain them. Very impressed with his professionalism! Our hibachi dishes were very fresh, expertly prepared & very delicious! As the time approached 10pm they started stacking the chairs at the tables all around us & our waiter came over and asked, (as my friend was taking his last few bites of the food that was still on his plate), "" So, are you guy done?""  I think my friend was a little embarrassed & so he put his fork down & said ""yes, we're finished."" Ok, that was really the last straw for me with this kid. I was horrified! Then after basically shaming my friend to stop eating, our young waiter actually had the nerve to tell my friend that he would have to charge him a surcharge for the two pieces of sushi that she didn't eat. What?!? Are you serious?!?
I wish Yelp would make two separate ratings for reviews, one for service & one for food because while I'd love to be able to give credit where credit is due-- our food was GREAT (5 stars) and so was our Chef but the wait staff & the hostesses were THE WORST! Hopefully the mgmt will read this review and spend a lot more time training/re-training their staff. I'd really love to give this place another try, but I'm hesitant. Maybe I'll try the New Tampa location.",1,"bad"
"5","If you're looking for the WORST dinner experience in your life look no more. 

I want to start off by saying I work in hospitality management in Nashville; I am pretty forgiving knowing what it takes to run a smooth operation for a restaurant. That being said, I have never been so disrespected in my entire life!!! 


Tuesday night we came in for my mother's birthday celebration with a group of 8. First impression was NOT great at all. The outside windows has tint peeling off and crinkled up. Looked pretty ghetto. We were sat and greeted to the hibachi table. Chair cushions were cracked and falling apart. I had to ask to see a drink menu, where there were missing inserts and pages were splitting. Terrible wine list, maybe 4-6 wines total to choose from. My mother an I opted for a glass of The Dreaming Tree Cabernet. Not bad. My moms was served with a clear visual of lipstick on her glass before it even hit the table. I asked the lady (which turned out being the manager) for a new glass and she seemed annoyed. 

We wanted to order food and she told us she would grab our server, which took another 10 minutes. When he finally got there he gave us an explanation as to why he was late. Whatever. 

We all were under the impression it was $18 for the adult hibachi dinner, which would include a soup and salad, meat of your choice, noodles, rice, and veggies. That was not the case. Brian our server made it as confusing as possible explaining the options for us. We're all pretty hungry at this point so we opt for the ""endless hibachi"" (whatever that is). He tells us sushi rolls are included as well. I ordered two rolls which were both pretty gross, mainly just rice and a soggy order of vegetable tempura. 

Our lovely server Brian continues to tell us that our hibachi chef just got here from China 2 weeks ago and he's pretty new, doesn't speak English. Thanks for informing us for our lackluster experience we will about to receive. 

It wasn't until we got our rice and noddles my sister noticed we never got our soup and salad. I go to speak with our server and he's chatting behind the bar with another employee. Apparently we have to tell him we wanted a soup and salad. WTF?! Since when did I have to tell you that when it's included in the price?? Finally comes out and the soup tastes like watered down brown gravy. So gross and salty. 

Our hibachi chef asked who wanted saki out of squeeze bottle. My mom decided to play along. He completely misses and squirted it all over my 66 year old mother. It only gets better from here. 

Finally we get settled in to our dinner, where we see 4 servers sit and the table next to us and start eating and rolling silverware! Never had I ate with what felt like their break room. If you see customers eating it's common sense you go somewhere else to eat!! 
 
Food was mediocre at best. My sister had to keep getting up to get her 2 year old daughter water. No bussing or refills. Dirty dishes just sat there as Brian came up to the table multiple times. We do a birthday cake and get the check. TWO HOUR DINNER LATER. 

My mom wanted a box to take to go. $2 up charge to take your food home. Unreal. 

At this point I ask to speak with the manager. Brian has the audacity to point at the front door and tell me she's over there, if you want to talk to her get up yourself, I'm not bringing my manager over for you. Tries to call me out for ""acting like this"" on my moms birthday. WOW!!!! SO RUDE. 

I go up to the lady which seems completely unfazed. I tell her of our bad experience and how rude my server Brian was. Says basically nothing and just stands there continuing to work on her calculator. Brian continues to push the situation after I told him I work in hospitality and this is completely unacceptable. He starts questioning me where I work and what the name of the place is. Are you f***ing kidding me?? I said excuse me and he asked if I spoke English. WOW. 

Again manager just stands there says nothing. This is how you let your employees talk to your customers? I tell her I do not want to leave him a tip after the disrespect I have received. She tells me it's already included in the bill. Naturally, does nothing. Instead says ""Jesus Christ you need to calm down"" 


I will NEVER forget my experience here.",2,"bad"
