"2","I visited Vitascope Hall five times while in New Orleans over a week. My experiences varied as certain days the service was slow although the restaurant was empty but the food was always wonderful and the servers attentive and great! The Creamy Cavatappi blew my mind. It was creamy flavorful and a huge dish, I took my left overs and ate them before the plane ride home. The alligator sausage and the crawfish were excellent on the pasta. My second favorite dish was the New York Steak. The potatoes were delicious and the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender, it cut like butter. My next was the Nola Fish and Chips. I subbed wedges for fries and it was crazy good. I also had the Catch of the Day, I didn't get the fishes name (not salmon) it was flavorful and I didn't go into a food coma full of regret although I will always prefer the comfort foods. I also had the Quattro Formaggi pizza. It was good but not what I expected from what is described. My reason for the 4 star is because of the plastic type plates. When cutting my steak the plate kept spinning. Especially being we were in the small booth that allowed us to people watch. For steak, you need real plates that will not move a centimeter I believe. Other than that, my experience was amazing and I miss the pasta and the elegance of the restaurant with the beautiful bar. Thanks for the experiences!",1,"good"
"3","This review is based on 3 separate occasions throughout my trip in New Orleans.

This is one of the restaurants located in the Hyatt Regency Downtown as well as the restaurant that provides the room service to the hotel. If you choose to eat in the establishment the atmosphere is nice. It has the feel of an ""upscale"" sports bar. I mean for 10 dollars a beer, it better at least look high end. Tvs are everywhere as well as private tables with personal Televisions. This would be a good spot to watch a game.

I ordered breakfast, lunch, and a dinner meal throughout my stay. The first order I received was to the room for breakfast. The service was very quick. It took at most 20 minutes for the food to be delivered on two separate occasions. The food, depending on what you get, is hit or miss. For breakfast I received a spinach egg white omelet with breakfast potatoes and croissant. The potatoes and croissant were delish! The main on the other hand was undercooked and runny. Not what I was expecting for 25 dollars plus tip. The second order I placed was for lunch. Again, very fast delivery! This time I got the Cajun chicken pasta. It definitely had potential but was lacking salt and pepper, both of which were not provided in the bag. The last time I ordered dinner at the restaurant. I received buffalo wings, fries, and sushi. The wings were very crispy and flavorful! The fries...well they could use some salt but did not diminish the quality of the meal. The sushi... OH THE SUSHI. It was delicious! I would continue to order that sushi every time I had a craving if I lived in New Orleans. If you come to
This restaurant give it a go! Overall the dinner food was way more impressive than the breakfast and lunch options.  I would only come back for the sushi.",2,"good"
"4","Was in NOLA back in February 2016 for the LSBA Small Firm conference and first day in arrived late afternoon and just didn't feel like trekking out and about cause the hotel this place is located in was so huge (Hyatt Regency)...

Wandered around and noticed this place as an in-house option...thought I'd try it out...Bad Idea! The sign at the entrance said Seat Yourself...I did and was then promptly ignored by 3 different servers...and the place was sparsely populated

Guess I wasn't packing the right equipment to catch attention...I say that because shortly after I was passed by for the 3rd time a group of honeys walked in, probably from the Watermelon Convention, and they pretty much needed lion tamer's equipment to keep the waiters at bay...

So I thought ""F"" this and moved to the bar...wasn't any better there...especially after I told the barkeep I just wanted a water to drink...finally get an order placed and when it came out the barkeep service was just short of flinging the plate down on the bar...

Now let's get to this crappy overpriced burger...the bun was stiff like it was over toasted but fell apart like it was stale...also it was billed as a ""Gourmet"" burger and I've found that means it don't come with diddly but meat and a bun...no pickles, no onions, no lettuce...asked the bar staff about that, at this point as politely as I could muster, and you'd have thought I'd just landed from Mars...they end up bringing me a bowl with some stuff that looked like kimche(?)...

The patty itself was cooked decently so that was a pleasant surprise but the fries were burnt...all in all wasn't worth the $20 it cost me and honestly if I want to be treated like dog shit on a hot sidewalk and served a terribly cooked meal I'll simply call my ex-wife up and see if she'll invite me over for supper...",1,"bad"
"5","I stay at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans all the time. I even have mid tier status with Hyatt. The ""manager"" greeted us after 10 mins of waiting at the front. We even walked around the restaurant to see where the best place to sit my party of 6-12 people. We were fine with sitting at a table that would adequately fit 6 of us but was presented with a table made for 4... with 2 comically  stools that appeared made for children. We put the stools back and grabbed real chairs as the width from the chair to aisle made 0 difference. The ""manager"" comes back and says we can't do that and have to go back to stools. I explain that the difference is negligible and I was confused how the manager was not accommodating our situation at all. We even see 2 areas that could have fit us perfectly. 1 of which was dirty when we walked in. And still was dirty 20 mins after our debacle. She said that section had no server. When I asked why our server that we would have had couldn't walk 30 feet over... she said that it would be stretching our servers too thin. She also said the other tables were reserved. She said all of this will very low confidence. She moved us to another 4-top. Again... we have 6. She said we can add 2 chairs on the end of the new table. I made a joke and said ""yes, we can add 2 tiny stools at the end"" I was surprised she did not like the joke. I would have left this place if my friends didn't insist on staying. I will probably start staying at Hyatt Centric on French quarter in the future.",2,"bad"
