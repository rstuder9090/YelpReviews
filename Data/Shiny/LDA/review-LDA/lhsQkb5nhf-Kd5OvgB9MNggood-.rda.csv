"2","I think this Valenica location has a pretty good benefit by being near the airport.  It gets a lot of traffic on the whole and I believe that really helps in keeping the fish very fresh.  Here in the desert, we can use everything we can to help get fresh fish!

Aki-san is a chef that came over from Sushi Garden (yes he knows Seki-san at Sushi King, they both worked together at one point).  Aki-san is on the left (customer perspective) and is the one that can't stop moving.  The head chef I actually don't know his name yet.  I always refer to him as the ""surfer chef"" though with my coworkers as he frequently wears a Billabong shirt under his chef shirt and the logo on the back is sometimes barely visible when he turns around.  He's also pretty young (30ish?) for a sushi chef and I can picture him on a board.  That said, Asians have that whole ""I look way younger than I really am"" thing going on, so he's probably really like 50 or something.

I try to vary up sitting in front of both to get both experiences.  Aki-san is really good with nigiri-zushi.  The surfer chef is really good with nigiri-zushi and maki-zushi.  The tamago here is always good.  Aki-san will warm it up a bit which I think makes it even better!  If you like to go tempura with maki, try the Vegas Roll.  I think Sachiko restaurants make the best Vegas Rolls.  Hamachi/yellowtail is always fresh and good, they also have hamachi toro here and give that a try if you haven't yet.  Buttery goodness!  They usually have aji/spanish mackerel too.  It's not marinated like typical saba/mackerel.  It's raw and very fleshy and still has that mackerel taste to it.  Usually dressed with ginger.  Very delicious.  Saba is also good here.  Quality can vary a bit on the Saba, but almost always really good.

Portions at Sachiko restaurants have a tendency to be a bit on the large side.  But still usually one-bite sized, just with some effort!  I think a lot of people like larger portions, and this is probably a good middle ground for traditional purists and value minded folks alike.

Andy: I think you mean the Wilmot location.  This Valencia location is a bit more expensive, I think 3.50 for salmon.  And Wilmot has the projection TV.  Valencia only has a small ~20"" TV above the refrigerator behind the bar.",1,"good"
"3","I've been here a few dozen times, and its growing on me.  The short of it is, it's better than average, and you could do a whole lot worse in Tucson, but not much better as far as sushi goes.

The sushi prepared at this site is adequately balanced, rice vs fish, its always fresh, and its reasonably priced.  The service is pretty good, the majority of the time efficient, but when I'm in a hurry, I just tell them I'm in a rush and ask them to assist me if they can.  In every instance, they've been really fast and accommodating.

Nothing in particular sticks out, but they do a good job of preparing food to go, and the specials plastered to the little desk as you walk in and behind the sushi counter offer some good deals.  I find whatever boat specials they have to be incredibly generous for the $12 or so they usually cost.

So if you are on the south-side and looking for a healthy alternative, I recommend giving this establishment a try.",2,"good"
