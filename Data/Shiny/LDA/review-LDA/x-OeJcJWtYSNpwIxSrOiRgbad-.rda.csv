"2","The Sushi is not made by trained Sushi Chefs as Margaret  Kuo's but it is better than nothing, Whole Foods has better sushi. i come here for the Salt and Pepper Shrimp. 
Nothing is outrageously bad. The Pizza offering is a great opened face grilled cheese, the meat loaf gives any greasy spoon a run for their money.
Its cheap oriental buffet food with Hibachi Offerings that depending on the day of the week you makes a great way to stretch out your time here.
We try to make more trips to Pearl or Sampan than here; but when hungry and on the Pike we come back.

Would hate to see this spot become a strip mall-hair and nail salon; will continue to eat here but not as as an end of the world if not.

 The 15th of October, 2016, the Cashier/Manger came over to talk with us and addressed the ""Elephant"" in the room, me.
The help who had noticed the drastic change in my health/appearance, tried to hide their reactions and not hurt my feelings. He asked if i was alright? 
Our conversation lasted a good amount of time.

We, now, have the Dynasty Buffet as our Friends, too!",1,"good"
"3","When it comes to buffets believe it or not this is our go to place for myself and my husband for several reasons.  First, they are very reasonably priced so you can stop in for a quick bite and still not feel like you overpaid because it's a buffet.  Secondly the wait staff and the manager have always been very friendly and accommodating.  When you have a finished plate they pick it up right away and always ask if you need a refill on your beverage.  The atmosphere is quieter and not as hectic as some of those gigantic buffets and sometimes that's just what we want.

Now I have to address the issues people have mentioned about food before where when it comes to buffets, it is common knowledge that sometimes you have a dish that is sitting out for a little while.  Let me just say that due to our work schedules we come in pretty late and close to closing time, and we do not expect the food to be perfectly piping hot the moment we walk in.  When we are among the last patrons of the evening, we simply do not expect this.

However, I feel it is important to note that no matter what time we show up, even if we are the last customers in the building, the staff are always asking us if there is a particular food that we want made fresh on the spot, if for example they see us browsing the aisles and some of the trays look mostly empty or not as fresh.  Usually we are ok with it but they regularly remind us that if there is anything that we want more of made fresh to please let them know.  

In our experience, Dynasty Hibachi Grill and Buffet has always been a very welcoming place for us to go eat, and the staff are always going above and beyond expectations to make sure we are getting the best possible service.  To us, their efforts do not go unnoticed, and for this we will always be returning here.",2,"good"
"4","It is rare that I downgrade a place.  But we definitely now have a ""Meh, I've experienced better"" situation here.  

The issue here is that I've had decent meals here in the past.  But this week after stopping there because I needed a quick bite on the way home at 8:30pm, I had a meal that not only just didn't even taste close to fresh, it affected me gastronomically as well.  I wasn't poisoned by any means, but let's just say my insides let me have it later.   

They have a battered tempura sushi option that I tried which I can honestly say that I had no idea what I ate.  I can tell you that it was cold, clammy, and chewy.  These are not good signs.  I decided I would go for more Americanized options after that.  I tried the barbecue chicken and it lacked flavor, but didn't lack grease.  I had wonton soup, and the wontons tasted like they had been sitting out for hours.  I even tried the pizza, and... well, actually the pizza wasn't terrible.  It was good for Chinese buffet pizza, 98% cheese and maybe 2% sauce. I needed to have some ice cream just to say I ate something pretty good.  

I didn't go for the hibachi, basically because the hibachi grill guy disappeared.  And the waitstaff... well, let's just say that you wonder when a waitress walks past your table with a water pitcher, looks right at your empty water glass, fills up someone else's water, then puts the pitcher back and walks away.  

I'll be fair and say that maybe I can chalk this up to visiting closer to 9pm.  Perhaps you'll have a better experience if you visit at a different time.",1,"bad"
"5","Wow.  I haven't had worse in a LONG time.  Payed $10.50 or so for dinner buffet on a Thursday evening around 7pm, and I seriously considered asking for my money back.  I'm vegetarian and although I didn't expect too many options given the mainstream look of the place, the veggie options were bad: fried rice? half cooked and tasted instant.  Veggie lo mein? super greasy and tasteless.  Egg foo yung? super greasy and tasteless.  Sushi ( I occasionally indulge)? like canned tuna salad but worse, with wasabi that tastes like sawdust.  Coconut dumplings? tasty, but I don't give Dynasty credit for that, as I'm certain most of this is shipped frozen.  

My wife is a meat-eater, and felt like the meat could have been *anything* disguised in tons of oil and sugar and red food coloring.  She said even the fake crab (which can be good & cheap) tasted super old and bland.  

We kept going back to the buffet thinking we might like something up there, but 1200 calories later found us regretful.  I felt sorry for giving no tip which I haven't done on purpose since a wee clueless lad.  Maybe it's significant that very few Asian-looking people were eating there?  This buffet might be worth it if it costed $3.00.",2,"bad"
