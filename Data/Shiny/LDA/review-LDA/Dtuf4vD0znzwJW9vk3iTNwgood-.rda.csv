"2","I really really like most Asian cuisines and my cabinets are full of most ingredients to make from scratch at home.  I have found that it's hard to find extremely good Asian restaurants here in Indy.  (spoiled w/San Francisco-don't mean to be a snob-I love Indy)  
I rec'd a message from a kind yelper to suggest her fav's.  So this afternoon I went on a trek to check out all the Asian restaurants I could find on line.  **Warning pictures can be dangerous if you're planning on staying home that night!  
I came across all the good reviews about this place and then started shuffing thru the PICTURES posted. OMG!  What a great sushi presentation they have.  By the time I was done, I was already choosing what I would order tonight.  When my guy came in and he didn't smell any tantalizing aromas in the air, he knew we were going out again.  So off to Tomo's we go.  He had a hard day, so we went early and we were the 3rd table there.
--The service was great.  We were greeted warmly & seated promptly.  The decor was nice the place was very clean.  -a lil surprising for a strip mall by Walmart. We ordered drinks. He liked his Manhattan, but the drink I always order, had way too much sweet & sour.  I said something to the waitress and the Mngr was close.  She immediately came to the table, took the drink and kindly said, ""I'll take it off your bill, can I get you anything else?""  OH yeah baby--customer service!! 
--He likes fried appetizers, so we ordered the oysters & calamari.  They were tasty.  I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce (mainly tamari) so I asked for something a lil milder and a lil sweeter.  She brought Yum Yum sauce-yummy!
--We ordered sushi for our entree.  A few minutes later the Mrgr came again.  She said that the chef had mistakingly made the mango lobster roll instead of the lobster roll we ordered.  She apologized and said he will be making your order now  unless you want that one.  I said well bring us one to sample and we'll let you know.  She said, great idea and if you like it, there won't be any up charge because it was a lil more.  OH yeah baby--customer service!
--We tried, it was very yummy and I gave the chef a thumbs up.  We also rec'd the Keystone roll which we ordered and it was my fav!  My husband couldn't stop raving about the presentation and the wonderful sauces that were served with them.  I loved the sauces too.  
--The sushi stole the show!!  Yum Yum, we will be back, skip the appetizers and have the hibachi & sushi!",1,"good"
"3","A couple years ago, I actually purchased a Tomo Gift Certificate for a friend largely on the recommendation of a friend who'd felt like the person I was buying for would appreciate their sushi options. Despite having never been there myself, I went in and purchased the gift certificate and found myself impressed by the friendliness and atmosphere. 

Flash forward to last night when I met fellow Yelpers Rick G. and Holly G. for dinner after what had been a mentally draining day for all of us due to different reasons. We wanted to hang out together, enjoy a good meal, soak in a decent atmosphere and not have to be ""on."" 

Mission accomplished. 

I'm not a sushi guy and I can even say that Japanese is not really my favorite type of cuisine. However, I don't ""dislike"" it and occasionally find that it really hits the spot. I arrived last night at the strip center spot it's located at - a former Discount Video in an area that is kind of hit-and-miss. I already knew that their curb cut at the end of the sidewalk closest to Tomo isn't even close to ADA compliant. It's a steep grade and if you have any upper body issues, there's no way you'll make it up it. I'm fairly decent in terms of upper body strength and even I have to get a bit of a good start to make it up without wheeling backward. 

Once you go in, you have a small entry way and then an entrance that leads to a Hibachi area to the left and a traditional dining room on the right. Tomo also recently started offering online ordering via their website and they also offer delivery. 

Due to a delay at their homestead, Rick and Holly arrived a bit late and after waiting in my car for a few minutes I decided to go ahead and hang out inside. You really get a sense of the ambience as it gets dark outside - the restaurant is dimly lit and the hibachi area was quite lively last night. One table, in particular, seemed to be having way too much fun and I was way impressed with one area that had the flames really going higher than I've seen for hibachi. It was fun to watch even though we were in the more traditional dining room. 

We sat at a 4-top. The server was friendly and attentive. I'd had my first iced tea refill even before Rick and Holly arrived, while I perused the menu. Rick had recent posted a photo of their Katsu Don, a ""breaded pork or chicken cutlet deep-fried onion carrot & egg over rice."" After considering a Teriyaki dish, I went with the Katsu Don and chose pork over chicken. The arriving dish was far more substantial and looked somewhat different than I'd seen in Rick's photo, though we all agreed it was likely the difference between a lunch special and dinner. This was Rick and Holly's first time being there for dinner. 

The food was quite good - I would likely order it again, though I will confess that Rick's dish looked even better and I think I might experiment a bit. My dish was definitely more than I could eat - somewhat rare for me, and I ended up bring some home. 

This was the definitive 4-star experience for me. The food was very good, the atmosphere quite enjoyable (and way better than you'd expect looking at the strip center), and the service was top notch. The prices are definitely higher for dinner - Rick and Holly ended up surprising me by picking up the bill (""We have a coupon!""), but they seemed to be happy with the value. 

Overall, I wouldn't say Tomo will be a regular spot for me but it's definitely a place I won't hesitate to return to and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up on my ""once in a while"" rotation. I will also note that they have lunch specials that are incredibly affordable if you want to give them a try and have a lesser commitment.",2,"good"
