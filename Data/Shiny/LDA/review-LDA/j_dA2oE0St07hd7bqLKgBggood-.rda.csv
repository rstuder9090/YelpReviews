"2","Love the sushi here. The staff is friendly and always attentive. Awesome sushi lunch special of $13 for 3 rolls and choice of soup or salad. I started off with hot green tea. The tea had perfect strength with a velvet like smoothness. They gave me sugar and it wasn't funky like other asian cuisine places where it may clump and stick like wet sand or you have to break up hardened sugar packets!! Not here :) Each sip was pleasant and the staff kept my cup topped off. I decided to begin my meal with the clear soup in lieu of the miso. Glad I did because the clear soup hit the spot since it was very cold out. Each spoon full seemed to blanket the perfect temperature plus the sodium level was ideal. The few strands of seaweed at the bottom was a nice touch giving you a little bit of substance. I was boring and chose all 3 of the same rolls and I'm glad I did. The crunchy spicy crab roll was AMAZING!!!! The crunch made this roll was special as each bite gave me the texture that I was craving. The crab mix was flavorful and did not elicit any fishy smell. A sign of great ingredients! The spicy mayo on top was the ideal amount as each mouthful was not overwhelmed. The meal ended with complimentary fresh cut fruit that lay inside a bowl made from its carved out fruit skin. Juicy and flavorful. ToYo is a place for a great meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. This place is a must for quality cooked or uncooked sushi at a price point that won't break the bank! An added bonus (only at the Philly location) are ToYo bucks given toward future meals. They come in denominations of $1 and $5 depending on the total of your bill. They lay inside your bill and keep in mind there are expiration dates that won't be honored if you exceed that date. Nobody is turning down free sushi. A nice touch and unexpected addition! You're Welcome for this find. Fyi, there is another ToYo in Doylestown. (same management)",1,"good"
"3","Get the gyoza soup. It's like wonton soup's prettier, smarter sister. You know the one. You see the family portrait and just feel bad for the ugly one. 

The soup is 'pricey' at 8.95 but it can serve a few as a side or be a meal for 2 people. Floating in a rich clear broth and surrounded by ribbons of cabbage and mushroom tasty plump gyoza that is packed with filling goodness. The broth is flavorful from the mushrooms and cabbage. The textures are all pretty consistent with soft mushrooms that just have a slight bite to them still, cabbage that is soft , but not mushy, and gyoza that is made of paper thin wonton liners. 

The sushi is fantastic too! I got a spicy tuna roll which was really good but the show stopper was the Don Roll. The inside is spice tuna but the outside is covered with thin pieces of eel, yellow belly tuna, and avocado. It's a huge roll and is a really good. The spicy tuna is actually spicy and the eel was cooked to perfection- slight tangy char on the edges. The yellow belly tuna is something new to me but it made a perfect menage a trois of fish.

I tried my friend's sweet potato roll and that was simple but good too. They just execute everything really well here.",2,"good"
