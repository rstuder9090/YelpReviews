"2","A couple of weeks ago an event popped up on Facebook to go to an open house for Katsumi's Teaching Kitchen's new location in Beech Grove. I thought I would go take the half hour tour and see what it was all about. I had read about the kitchen in I believe Indianapolis monthly. During the free tour Mori gave us a chopstick lesson and explain the differences between Chinese and their traditions, Korea and their traditions, and the Japanese, I can say that I am not very good at managing the chopsticks yet. During the free tour she also fed us cake that has a matcha green tea icing and gave us a new apron. I was impressed with her attitude and how well she answered everyone's questions. I decided to schedule a class for the following week. I scheduled myself into the Japanese street food class.

In the Japanese street food class I learned to make yakisoba, okonomiyaki, and takoyaki. The class was a lot of fun. Each step of the way Mori shows you what to do and helps you if you need help with anything. Also we had the cake again at the end! The people that were in the class with me were all nice and looking to learn something new. I will say I got a bit warm in the kitchen with all of the skillets working and everybody in there. Mori provided everything we needed to prepare ingredients and also an apron to keep our clothes clean as we worked. Everything we made was very flavorful and she explained all of the ingredients and let us take pictures of them as she went along. I am confident that I can make these dishes at home and isn't that what it is all about?

I liked the class so much that I have already scheduled my next class. I am learning how to make potstickers the third week in April. Come and give it a try and I think you will be glad that you did.",1,"good"
"3","I took my sister-in-law here as a birthday present. The 90 minute class (which ended up closer to the 2 hour mark) focused on teaching the basics: spring/summer rolls, California rolls, miso, and a Japanese dessert (we had white chocolate matcha fondue). I've made spring rolls and California rolls before but never through a class. Having completed the class, I'm very glad I did. Mori is a natural teacher and provided a lot of information that was accessible for those who don't know a lot about food and even those who do. She has a very practical approach to cooking - as an introductory class, she taught us about umami but was mostly interested in having us get good-looking food on the table without it being overwhelming. She was very encouraging, and I felt so empowered by what I had learned that I threw my own little sushi-making dinner party at home later that week. At several points during the class, she had a little photo op set up for us to take photos of our creations - which all 8 of us in the class took advantage of. What I liked best about the class was her advice on which food and cooking products were the best to buy (and where), and reasons for why certain products were better than others. As a white Midwestern girl, it made it possible for me to go to an international grocery store and know exactly what to get so that I could recreate good sushi at home. I cannot understate how valuable this aspect of the class was.

Mori teaches other classes, and I plan on taking all of them. She also is working on getting together a Korean cooking class that I am salivating just thinking about. Her cooking school is relatively new, but I see her being here for the long haul. We had a lot of fun making Japanese food in a positive environment. She is the only Japanese food teacher in the state, and we are lucky to have her.

Long story short: GO TAKE A CLASS HERE!",2,"good"
