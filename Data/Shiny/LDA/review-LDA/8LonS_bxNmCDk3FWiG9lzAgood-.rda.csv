"2","I just went here for vegan restaurant week, and I have to say, I am so impressed. I've been hearing about this place and I should have gone sooner!

First off, this is my favorite kind of place--they are an omni restaurant that serves ""regular"" sushi and ramen, but they also have an extensive vegan menu--in fact I think they have a vegan version of 70% of their menu. However, the vegan offerings are so good that I saw plenty of omnivores getting them--including my companion, who came here for tonkotsu ramen, and needed up ordering the vegan bao buns and chao roll as a side.

Second off, their vegan rolls are seriously a step above. I love regular vegetable rolls--vegetables are delicious! But it was really great to be able to get deluxe rolls of the kind I usually never get the chance to try, and innovative and unusual ones at that. Using marinated eggplant as an alternative/substitute to eel is genius. The texture and slight sweetness work so well as a counterpart to the same flavor profile. (I don't think that's part of their regular menu--seems to be a current specialty item--but it should be).

I don't know what they use for their spicy vegan ""tuna,"" but it tastes surprisingly like fish, without being too fishy (since I don't want to actually eat fish). I guess I would say it had similar notes, while still being its own thing.

My companion's ramen was silky smooth. The bao buns were fluffy and savory and pleasantly filling.

But the thing that really put my opinion of Tomo over the top was their attention to detail. Their restaurant presentation is gorgeous (and the rolls are like works of art), but that's true for many nice sushi restaurants. However, I asked to take some of my meal home in a to-go box, and when I got home, I got a really pleasant surprise--they had carefully assembled my food to look like a brand new order instead of leftovers. The remaining rolls were neatly re-arranged, there was a little soy sauce container, and they included a fresh serving of wasabi and pickled ginger. I think there was a little flower, too. Such a nice extra touch.",1,"good"
"3","I've been wanting to come here for a few months because of their beautiful veggie rolls!

I decided to order the Midori roll, the Lime Sinko, the Straw-Veggie and the Vegan Spicy Tuna (that I saw originally on Instagram.) 

It was a beautiful display! The straw-veggie was sweet but vinegary from the pickled vegetables. The lime sinko reminded me of a sushi key lime pie. It was filled with a creamy avocado and cucumber, which made the lime sinko topping shine. The midori was creamy from the avocado topping and salty from the pickle vegetable filling. The vegan spicy tuna was out of this world! Initially it tastes like a savory sesame taste and then the juicy tomato kicks in. It has a texture very similar to tuna but is it's only thing. The spicy kicks in at the end. 

For $42 of sushi, we weren't full. So we ordered a bowl of vegan miso ramen to share. It was delicious! We loved the noodles, the sweet tofu, the juicy mushrooms and the amazing umami broth! Would love to have a bowl in the winter. 

Tomo is a culinary experience, definitely a little pricer than expected but worth it. Check them out!",2,"good"
