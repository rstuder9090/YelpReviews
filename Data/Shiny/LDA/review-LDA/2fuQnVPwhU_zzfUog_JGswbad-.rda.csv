"2","Two words; yummy and wholesome!! This place is a ""must try"" spot with that devout heart and soul, home-cooked, made with love, meal feel. The chef and owner of this place, who my family and I were lucky enough to meet, is a sweet, Thai mother whose abundant motherly warmth shines in her cooking. Just from that we knew why the food tastes so good! We tried the classic pad thai, pad see ewe, drunken noodles (we ordered them all with beef), tempura fried soft shell crab, and they were ALL delicious. Each noodle dish had their own flare, but had the commonality of soft, supple noodles evenly coated in their own vibrant sauce. They were very much stick to your ribs asian soul food. As dessert we had the thai tea, banana boba, and the taro boba, which were the cherry on top and great finish to the meal. The tapioca balls were cooked just right, and we all agreed that the taro one was the best from the rest. Also, to make the experience even more worth the visit was the look of the place itself. The place is very beautifully decorated with added structural work done to bring that Thai aesthetic to life. I would say more, but you will just have to witness it for yourself hehe. Anywho, I definitely would recommend you give this place a try and know you are getting a meal filled with love.",1,"good"
"3","Pad Thai is kind of a benchmark dish for Thai places.  Although it's kinda hard to mess it up, I've found it's generally a pretty good indicator of how good a place is.  Had the Pad Thai at Tin's House today, and it was fantastic.  Also had spring rolls (really good), and the soup and salad that came with the meal were good, albeit fairly standard.  I'm definitely interested in trying more from their expansive Thai menu.

And then we went with the Roti Nohm Wan (sweet milk roti) dessert.  As good as everything else was, this dessert was on a different level entirely.  Do NOT eat here without ordering this dessert.  I can't think off the top of my head of any restaurant where I would be likely to order dessert.  I will be going back to Tin's House many times, and I will be getting this dessert every single time.

Prices were fair, service was exceptional (not busy at all), food came out quickly, and the space is clean and nicely decorated.  Portions of the Pad Thai are pretty good size, which I find to be typical of most Thai restaurants.  I can't speak to the sushi or Japanese side of the menu.  I'm usually a little hesitant of places that serve more than one kind of ethnic food.  The Thai food here is terrific, so I'd be surprised if the Japanese food wasn't up to par as well.",2,"good"
"4","I'm pretty disappointed by our visit here. I saw all the fantastic reviews and was excited to try it. We don't live in the area, but I was working out here and thought we'd give it a try. I got the fried corn and pineapple fried rice. My husband for the basil fried rice. To start, the fried corn was very greasy and tasted like fair food, definitely not worth the price charged for it. We are a couple bites and couldn't stomach any more. The basil fried rice was edible, but I ended up boxing up the pineapple fried rice to possibly eat later. I ordered it medium spicy but it was loaded with red pepper flakes and SUPER hot!  Like my lips burned. I can usually handle spicy food, but this was more like hot and not medium. Also, the peas and carrots in the dish were most likely from frozen peas and carrots. They were crunchy and flavorless. The restaurant seemed a little dirty and disorganized. There was a sushi bar area that was super cluttered with all kinds of stuff, and it really made the place look bad. That stuff should be stored in the back kitchen area. Lastly, our server seemed miserable. She barely spoke to us until she dropped the check off, probably wanting a bigger tip. I am usually a very decent tipper but I had to force myself to tip 15% with this meal. I guess we will stick to our trusted Southside Thai restaurants.",1,"bad"
"5","Ugh.  It's been a long time since I've been so offended by food. 

There are so many good reviews!!  For that reason, you should try it.  It's definitely why I had my eye on this place for so long.  

Full disclosure, this was an UberEats order and there was some sort of an unexplained delay.  The food arrived lukewarm, at best, but that's the risk one takes with a third party delivery and is why I'm giving two stars vs. one. 

Crab Rangoon were okay. 

Curry Wraps were the texture of canned cat food with Indian spices in a thin phyllo-type dough triangle.  

Tom Yum Soup was very watery and very bland.  Very few veggies, but a decent amount of chicken for the portion. 

Masaman Curry w/ Fried Rice was thin and bland.  The fried rice was anemic, at best.  Poor showing on the protein and veggie side. 

Drunken Noodles were a full on WTF.  It was a nod to Pad Kee Maow.  I wonder if I got the wrong entree, but I'm not sure.  The noodles were different than the dozens and dozens of other places I've had this dish.  I mean, I don't know that they were No Yolks from Kroger, but if I were given a multiple choice question, I'd select this answer.  Very, very little protein.  Very small amount of veggies, but also just like maybe only carrot and onion.  Little to no sauce/flavor at all.  It was also a solid, congealed slab upon arrival.  Again, probably more related to the delay than anything. 

Steak Haven sushi roll was probably the best thing we had, but still a lil weird.  There was a strange flavor that I couldn't identify. 

Usually, we look forward to a lot of leftovers from a large meal like this, but a lot of food went down the garbage disposal tonight. 

Give it this place a try.  There's obviously something going on for some people, so you should try it.  Maybe dine in.",2,"bad"
