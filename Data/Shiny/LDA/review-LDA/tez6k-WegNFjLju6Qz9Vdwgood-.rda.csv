It came with the standard soup, salad w/ ginger dressing, shrimp, fried rice, and veggies. They don't have actual hibachi tables here which I think is a plus because that can take FOREVER when you are sitting there with a child.  I ordered sushi and a side of fried rice.  They have a wide selection of sushi.  The waitress was super nice and attentive. They have a few TVs and were playing the Titans game when we were there. I do have to say that they music selection was quite funny.  One song would play that would be japanese and the next song would be..say..Jason Aldean. The entire time we were there it alternated between country and japanese! Just funny to me.. :)",1,"good"
"3","Just ate lunch here for the first time and it was so good that I had to write a review RIGHT NOW before I forgot.  A friend had recommended this place, saying that the rolls were great and prices even better.  They were dead on!  It doesn't look like a huge place from the outside, but the inside is pretty spacious.  Tables and booths as well as a bar.

The service was excellent and even though they had a decent amount of folks in there for lunch, we were able to be seated immediately.  They have great prices on two and three roll lunch specials which are limited to about a dozen or so different types of sushi.  I wanted to try some fo the more ""elaborate"" rolls, so I ordered straight off of the sushi menu.  I had the Wasabi MT, Spicy Scallop and Trust Me rolls.  All three were great, but my favorite was the Trust Me.  There are no ingredients listed for it on the menu, and my friend explained that it's basically whatever the sushi chef decides to make that day.  I'm adventurous and today it paid off well!  The Trust Me roll was both savory and smoky with smoked salmon in it.  A little wasabi to go with it and you had pure bliss.

The Wasabi MT roll had some of the best lobster I've had in quote some time, and the Spicy Scallop roll was just the same with the scallops.  You can tell that the seafood is fresh, which is amazing for landlocked Tennessee.  The rolls were all fantastic and you couldn't beat the price.  This is definitely going on my short list of lunch haunts.",2,"good"
