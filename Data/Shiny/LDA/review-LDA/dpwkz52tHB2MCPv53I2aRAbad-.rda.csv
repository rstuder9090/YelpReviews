"2","How can it be that this place is around 2 years old, peeps here on yelp mentioning their name in other reviews, yet not having a review of their own? A little strange, to say the least. Well, here's their 1st review and from a Californian nonetheless, strange, right? 

An ambitious restaurant in a business-park zoned area made it a strange find. Upon entering however you're presented with a sleek, modern interior worthy of a romantic date. Curved, deep maroon walls flow throughout the space making the seating arrangement interesting. A far eastern touch is present as the larger tables had a marble lazy susan to spin your dishes to be served family style, nice looking but very cumbersome to spin. Metal chain mail see- through 
curtains separate the larger tables and is actually effective in providing a sense of separation from other diners. 

The service is western style with personable servers who pays attention to detail with wine service, verbal specials announcements and a comfy warm towel service at the end of the meal. The food is primarily Americanized Chinese food presented in a more stylish manner, real similar to PF Changs, only it taste more authentic. There is also a separate sushi bar area which can get quite busy but sushi can be ordered from the tables in the dining room. So an upscale Chinese restaurant, that serves up legit sushi to order, a full bar and respectable wine list with effective service, did I already say that Jazmine is one ambitious restaurant. The good thing is that they actually pull it off, definitely restaurant people in this independently owned restaurant, a gem of a find. 

5 of us ordered family style which started with a small nigiri selection from the sushi bar which included maguro (yellowfin tuna), saba (cured mackerel) and shiro maguro (albacore). All were very legit and priced properly and served with a little modern flair with flecked scallions on the saba and a dot of sriacha on the albacore. We also ordered shrimp siu mai which were large, juicy and delicious and probably one of the best I've had, and I'm from the Bay Area where dim sum joints are plentiful. So the mixture of Japanese sushi and Chinese dumplings as appetizers were an absolute treat, especially with our Columbia Valley Gewurtztraminer, now where else can one start a meal that way? Not many places in my experiences. 

Chinese entrees we shared were: 

Ginger Scallion Beef ($14)Properly textured beef with present ginger and scallion flavors, good rendition. 

Braised Tofu with Black Mushrooms and Vegetables ($12)Okay with the tofu being deep fried then braised. I may have preferred it not fried. Presented in a claypot which was nice. 

Szechuan Snapper ($14) Fillet of Pacific Snapper in a thickish spicy brown sauce. Fish was just ok but drowning in the gloopy sauce. A bad pick in my opinion. 

XO Dried Sauted String Beans ($12) Very properly executed with a little ground pork and garlic, shriveled yet firm beans with just enough sauce to get absorbed into the beans but not pool on the bottom of the dish. 

With some steamed white rice this proved to be a perfect amount for 5 hungry adults. Even though we were all satisfied with the meal thus far we still decided to indulge in a sampling of some dessert with some tea. I mean we were trying to set the tone for the up and coming new year, so bring it on. 

A Coconut Dream Cake was well...dreamy. Very moist layered white cake with a soft coconut cream between the layers was perfect with hot tea. 

A cheesecake which was described as a cherry cheesecake gave me an image of cherries being in the cake but on arrival it was just basic New York cheesecake with that traditional cherry filling topping. Though a decent rendition it was just too ordinary for me. 

A huge dinner for 5 with wine came out to about $130, which is definitely not a bad way to sample a multitude of dishes from different cultures in an upscale setting. To say the least, I'll be back here to celebrate if ever I wanna celebrate up here in Reno. Jazmine is a good find.",1,"good"
"3","First time Yelper!!

I'm from the Bay Area and I visit Reno about a dozen times a year.  I'm Chinese, so even on vacation, I miss the taste of plain steam rice.  I used to eat at Golden Fortune inside the Eldorado Hotel, but I heard the head chef left, and was the head chef at Jazmine's.  I've tried this place several times, and I absolutely love it.  The staff is absolutely amazing.  I don't know if it is because they know me by my first name, but the service has always been perfect.  

The food is great.  For starters, you have to try the crab cakes, the lettuce wraps, and the 5 spice chicken wings (especially if you are having a beer).  The Chef made me salmon cakes one time, it was amazing.  You should ask the waiters to see if the Chef has time to make you an order. I never ordered a soup, but it looks decent.  As for the main course, I love the beef with ginger and scallions, red snapper, baked seabass, Asian spice lamb chops, and the braised pork ribs.  You have to have veges, so I usually get the garlic sauteed vege (whatever is in season) or the egg plant (love egg plant).  I normally get plain steam rice, but if they have dried salted fish, i will ask them to make salted fish fry rice with chicken.

The drinks at this place is good and very reasonably priced.  I am not a big wine guy, but the manager, David, he is like some kind of wine expert.  I had him pick out some wine based off what I was having, and I have to say that the wines he picked out was a great compliment to my meals.  For the real drinks, you have to try their mojitos.  They make a great strawberry mojito when it is in season.  They have all types of beers and their liquor selection is complete.  I am a simple man, my best friend is Heineken, Mojitos when it is hot, and Patron silver when I am hurt (usually after the casinos).

The sushi bar wasn't always there, but I have to say it is a great addition.  I never had their all you can eat sushi deal, but I have ordered a few rolls, and they turned out pretty good.  Their fish is actually fresh, but of course it does not compare to the Bay Area. But for Reno, it is good sushi.

This probably doesn't apply to everyone, but they have good looking hostesses.  Where did these Asian girls come from?  I come to Reno a lot, and I have to say that Wendy (hostess), is the best looking Asian girl that lives in Reno.  I wanted to give this place 4 stars because Wendy has hurt my male ego many times now, I am hoping she will read this and won't turn me down the next time I ask her to marry me. LOL.",2,"good"
"4","I have been a regular at this sushi restaurant for over three years.  So, at this point I have a history with them, and for the most part it has been positive.  Well that all changed within the last month.  Not sure if they are under new management, or have some worthless employees they have not singled out or what.  So about three weeks or so ago, I ordered take out.  When you order ala carte, its expensive.  I know this up front, and do not have an issue with that.  But when my orders are normally somewhere higher than $50.00 each time, you would think they could get it right.  So, I pick up my order three weeks ago, and tell them it looks very large, yet they assure me it is correct.   I did not open each container to look.  I figured the amount of money I am spending, they should at least ensure my order is correct.  That is their job, not mine.  I am busy enough with my own work to have to check theirs.  After all, they have the business license for sushi, not me.  Well I pay my $65 plus for my order and get back to the office as I have a very short meal window.  I open my order and there is literally no sushi at all in the order.  I ended up with large multi meal order, none of it belonging to me.  I know they cannot take the order back as it has left their restaurant.  So, my office mates make out with free chow, yet I do not have chow.  So, I go back, and I am a bit perturbed, but I say nothing other than you messed up my order.  There are a bunch of the staff there, one appears to be a manager.  They all apologize, but I say nothing as I specifically asked them if it was correct before I departed.  I take my right order and back to the office. 
I am hoping it is a one-time mistake, not so.  I order today, another large order.  I remind them that I was the one they messed up on a few weeks back, and again they assure me that the order is correct.  I'm thinking there is no way they could do this to the same customer twice.  Get back to the office and sure enough, I get sushi, but am missing part of my order.  Now I am not too happy.  I call them and tell them they messed it up again and to have the manager call me.  I get no call, so I call back and tell them I want to speak with the manager.  He refuses to talk with me.  So, I tell them they had better take the items I am missing off my bill.  I cannot believe someone that is supposed to be a manager refused to speak with me about an obvious issue with his staff.  This speaks volumes about real customer service.  Customer service is not smiling as customers give you their hard-earned money for nothing.  Customer service is addressing the real problems they have created with their customers to make it right.  After all, they would be calling the police had I not paid them.  Yet talk to a customer that they just ripped off for money, nope, he will not take the call.  Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen in Reno.  What I have noticed with most of them is that they are super when they first open their doors, but steadily decline in quality and customer service as the time goes on.  I thought maybe I had struck it rich with Jazmine.  I have given them a lot of business, and have brought guest from out of town there as well.  Now they appear to be the same as the rest.  They will not get any of my business from this point forward.  Especially when a terrible manager refused to address the issue with a loyal customer.  You all will continue to fail and I look forward to seeing a for lease sign on your doors, or at least if I have anything to do with it.  If they are failing at customer service, how are they in let's say cleanliness, quality of food, health requirements for the storage of food and the list goes on.  Twice in a row for the same customer tells me they are failing in the rest of the areas.  I just sorted Jazmines reviews by rating.  Should have done that earlier, that falls on me.  Now after reading them, they are on a trend down for a reason.  Read the recent bad reviews, as they are stacking up.  The writing is on the wall as they say.  You would be well advised to stay away!!!!!",1,"bad"
"5","We reserved AYCE sushi dine-in for Saturday afternoon at 2pm. 
I was impressed with sign that let's you scan code and read the menu via phone. This scan is only for Chinese food. 

You are not allowed to order crab ragoon if you are eating AYCE sushi...oddly they cant even offer you to make it an additional side purchase.

Staff doesn't explain the difference between AYCE lunch $19 and for an additional $2/person Special AYCE lunch..so we ended up checking a part of the paper menu that isnt labeled or communicated until a later waitress gave us the breakdown. The chef scoffed at us for ordering more in the end ""you better eat those!""

The servers in white button up shirts are more communicative. There's a lot of crew members in polos walking around. Most will refill your drinks..they did seat us very promptly with sets and water glasses too. Food also came out fast. The guys in the polo's were first contact and we wish they had gone over the lunch price breakdown.

Tea per pot is $3 and they charge you $1.50 PER cup. Midway through the server took away one of our cups -_-.

Appetizer: We enjoyed the wings..my tastebuds were searching for a garlic flavor though!! 
The sliced cucumber in sweet sauce was refreshing.

Most rolls were bland...sweet sauce is a reoccurring trend.
There was a deep fried roll that stood out. 

Aha, At least we ordered most of what's on the SPECIAL roll menu section, but 
 they all ended up tasting too similar..again with the sweet sauce.

More than two of our nigiri orders were missed!! Communicate if you're out of supply!!
FYI lunch does not come with dessert. It is $3 for a single scoop of black cherry ice cream.

I ignored my gut knowing fusion restaurants are usually a miss!! Location convenience was why we tried Jazmine.
We would like to try Chinese take out someday, but this dine in experience was such a cold experience..upcharging patrons for every little doggone thing. We weren't even allowed to order crab ragoon for goodness sake!!

Skip Jazmine and just drive the extra few miles for legitimate AYCE sushi joint.",2,"bad"
