"2","I'm trying to think of the last time I was nervous to eat at a restaurant because of the restaurant itself.  For those that don't know Sam at Sam's Sushi is known as being the ""Sushi Nazi"" of Nashville.   This reference relates back to an old Seinfeld episode where a chef running a soup kitchen would yell at customers and say ""NO SOUP FOR YOU"".  In this case it would be sushi of course.  A couple of my Nashville friends had been here before and told me that they ordered miso soup and got no soup because Sam told them they ""didn't need it"".  Also, another friend had asked for the remainder of his roll to go and Sam told him he wouldn't let him take it to go because it ""wouldn't be good"" later.  These encounters are what made me wonder what I could expect.

Our friend Josh got there ahead of us and told Sam that he was a regular which helps to smooth things out.  Unlike most restaurants that welcome new guests Sam's isn't one of those.  (Tip:  even if it is your first time act like you have been there before and follow my experience below to know what to do).

Sam himself is a portly Japanese man who is the owner and chef.  The sushi joint is tiny so this is why he is in full charge.  The drill is that you get your menu, write down which rolls you want and take them up to the counter for Sam.  I wrote down my rolls and made a note that I didn't want cucumber.  My friend hissed at me, ""Heather, just take the cucumber out, we don't want to upset him"" but being the fact that I am a defiant and stubborn person I said, ""No, I don't want the roll made with cucumber and I'm going to tell him"".   To their horror I turned in my order as such but surprisingly Sam was nice about it.  He even told me that my 2nd roll that I ordered would have cucumber so did I want him to take it out too?  Phew, we passed that.

The only issue came later:  Sam put our trays of sushi up on the sushi counter and I swear I heard a bell ding so we all got up and approached the bar to get the order only to be yelled at, his arms flailing in the air because it wasn't ready yet, he wasn't ""finished with it"" and as he snatched the sushi trays back down we practically ran back to our seats.  A few minutes later he came out from behind the counter and brought us the food, cheerfully.  

You are probably wondering if the sushi is good?  It is good, not great, but good.  The best part is the price because you get two huge rolls for $5.00 during lunch and this will more than fill you up.  Go here for the price and to experience the rules and procedures of Sam.  Just be aware of all the little written signs in the place, such as ""No Tipping"" allowed (Sam hates tips) and also the sign on the napkin dispensers that say ""Don't Waste"".  As long as you can follow the rules you will have a great experience (final tip: read other Yelp reviews of this place to hear more Sam stories to be fully prepared).

Here's to sushi struggle!!",1,"good"
"3","The Best Sushi at the Best prices in the USA. This is like Chicago's famous Jimmy's Red Hots. Very Very Generous portions of good quality authentic food and very very generous prices.  Sam is a great guy, when he remembers you. But he is also a grouch. He is very touchy on alot of things, and HE DOES NOT WANT new customers. SO if you have never been there then please follow the following procedure to avoid getting on his nerves and getting yourself kicked out, ive seen him do it several times and even had me lock the door so nobody else could enter. So FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE.

WALK IN, dont slam the door in, no cellphone talking, no ruckus.. Just quietly and civilized walk in. Head straight to the bar which behind he stands. Avoid bumping into anything in the very small interior. Once at the bar, glance at the menu list which is on the wall, pick up the order pad and fill out EXACTLY.

any drinks or beer you got out of the fridge (DONT ASK WHAT HES GOT TO DRINK, look at the smal fridge, they offer SAPPORO beer at good price, try it)

Once you have written everything down, then just place it ontop of the bar and have a seat,  When you come in dont come in all happy jolly wanting to interview the man and dont start asking him if he knows the whereabouts of the karate kid actor etc.  He will ask you if you have been there before (like secret bordellos do) and you want to say YES, many times! and you always ask me the same thing, HAHAHA.. Ok stop the fake laugh and just ask him what he thinks about the presidential elections.. and you will have a fine dinning experience. I know the procedure sounds like WTF.. but trust me.. just follow it, especially if you take a date, it will keep you from emberassing yourself.. You will Look COOL and HIP since sam will usually chew out most customers and treats you like a shinobi homie. for under 5 bucks you get 2 FAT rolls.. if we were to compare this joint to most sushi places.. lets say your getting a cuban cigar compared to the typical virginia slims (for those of you who dont smoke, lil teeny skinny sissy cigaretes)  and also comes with a lil veggie salad. This alone will fill you up, for under 5 bucks, you can even share with your girl if she eats like bambi, both of you can eat for under 5 bucks. After you finish eating just leave the plate, make no attempt to pick anything up and DONT LEAVE a tip.. trust me he dont need your stinking greenbacks... His Yen gives our dollars wedgies.. thanks bush..

But seriously, I have ate many sushi all over the country.. and this is by far the best damn sushi ive had in my life.. The price is uncanny and the quality of the food and portion is just phenomenal.. 
This place can be easily missed, so look for the sign on the window, next to the printers alley big ol red street sign.

"4","like many others, i found this place through Yelpers.  i was visiting from CA, the land of great sushi.  my family and i had checked in late at a nearby hotel and i wanted sushi to go to eat at our hotel because it was so late and hot.  the website said he was closed at 9pm and the address is for the front of the building.  i had a heck of a time finding it in the back of the building since it was on another street and it was dark and the sign was not that obvious.  by the time i drove around in circles, parked illegally, i got to his door at 8:30pm.  there was one party inside the place w/ 4 people.  i told him i wanted to order to go.  he said NO!  i said it is not 9pm and i have been driving around looking for it for over 1/2 hour.  he told me to go to another sushi restaurant because he was tired and wanted to watch tv.  like an idiot, i quickly explained i was visiting and did not know any other place.  he asked why i was at his place and i said someone told me it was good.  i thought this answer might help, but his anger only intensified. again, he continued to ask why i was there. at this point, l finally realized he was looking for a particular answer.  when i did not answer it on the 5th time, he answered it for me by saying i was there because he was cheap.  at this point, i told him he was right and thought this would end the standoff.  his annoying attempt at humor was starting to piss me off but i kept my cool because i wanted to see if the hype behind this guy was worth the hassle.  once i finally conceded on being cheap,  he relented and asked what i wanted to order.  i asked for CA roll, Unagi roll, rainbow roll and shrimp tempura roll.  then, i asked if he still had miso soup for my son.  he started yelling again about how i have to go to another sushi place because he has no time to make such crap and wants to quit the restaurant and go back to japan.  at this point, i was not sure what to say or if i needed to respond.  then, there was some kind of boxing match on TV and i thought it was the Olympics.  while he was busy yelling and ranting, his eyes drifted upward to some boxing match on TV.  i was crazy enough to ask if he was watching the Olympics.  he gave me this dirty look and told me to be quiet and let him watch.  the other 4 people in the restaurant are listening to this exchange between us and they are horrified w/ pity look in their eyes.  but, they were still waiting for their food and could not leave.  once he was done preparing their food, in between watching boxing, he brought theirs out and then just sat down and continued to watch TV.  i stood there like an idiiot for about 5 minutes and just watched him watching TV.  i had considered getting up and leave and i knew that was exactly what he had hoped i would do, so i didn't.  it became the Mexican standoff.  after about 10 minutes, he decided to get up to make my rolls and started asking me where i was from and why i was in nashville.  i kept my answer short because i was seething but calm. he started to share personal stories about himself but he was just mumbling the information. at this point, i waited patiently while he was making my rolls.  i was wondering how he was going to fry the shrimp for the shrimp tempura roll.  i got my answer when he pulled out something from the fridge that looked fried shrimp but only cold and wet brown batter.  he put it into the microwave and heated up.  i just closed my eyes and knew i was screwed for thinking i would get decent sushi in nashville.  then it was the CA roll.   he just put some long slabs of imitation crab w/o any mayonaise, which is a must, slivers of avocado.  the other 2 rolls of ""fresh"" fish was jus a glob of fish that was not even remotely fresh or good.  the unagi were these crumbs of eel that he did not even bake.  the only fresh thing i saw in the entire process was the avocado.  in addition, he squirted a bunch of sriracha spicy sauce in 2 of the rolls and it tasted awful.  i am a huge fan of spicy food and able to handle ghost pepper w/ zero difficulties.  it was not the spice but the fact that it just did not fit into these so called fresh fish rolls.  it was so weird and out of place.  another word, it sucked the big one. 
i think the people in nashville and other yelpers should feel ashamed for raving and touting this horrible sushi as something good or great.  it is not cheap, but not free.  in fact, most of the sushi is simply rice and not even good rice at that.  in fact, i am not convinced, at all, that it is sushi grade rice.  it was too mushy and the texture was totally wrong.  i am pretty sure that sam is not even japanese and actually korean.  this ""sushi nazi"" he seems to portray and relish to punish unsuspecting customers that are curious to find out about his food is just simply stupid and annoying.  i think the whole thing is an act and he does it to exert control in his tiny little world.  cheap does not mean good!",1,"bad"
"5","Going here was the worst restaurant experience of my life, no question.

Sam runs this joint as a one man operation in Printer's Alley downtown. When I first walked into the tiny room (couldn't have been more than 250 sq ft), I was pleased at the sight of such an informal, distinctive, divey kind of hole in the wall. Horrible, yellowed posters as decor, cracks in the floor tiles, no air conditioning. I usually love little places like that (e.g. Edgefield in East Nashville). I was, however, sorely disappointed. 

Sam, who many people on this site and on City Search sympathize with for reasons unknown to me, is a complete jerk. The first greeting I received was ""NO WRITE ON MENU"". I was studying the small laminated menu, trying to decide what I wanted to order. I guess he assumed I was going to mark on it, the way a lot of sushi places have you order. 

I placed my order and specified what type of nigiri I wanted with my roll, as it didn't say on the menu what type came with the sushi combo plate. Instead of explaining things, he snapped again, ""You no get to pick all three same! You get what I put on plate!"" I took it and assumed it was my misunderstanding. 

I was careful to handle him with kid gloves and not get upset, as it's a relatively common occurrence for good restauranteurs and chefs to be prickly, neurotic, irregular characters. I have interacted with people like that before and had some of the best food I've ever eaten served by them - one of those ""good artists are drug addicted and suicidally depressed"" sort of phenomenon, except ""good chefs are insane and total jerks"".  I figured his personality might just be the price to be paid for outstanding cuisine. I was so, so wrong.

When our order was up, I went and grabbed it from the bar and sat down. The first thing I noticed was how sloppily it was assembled. Sushi is one of those culinary niches that takes pretty exacting technique and attention to detail. It takes practice and focus to make tight, neat maki, which is why it isn't something delegated in kitchens, but reserved for a specific sushi chef - a guy who knows what he's doing. Sam, with way too much rice spilling out of his maki and his loose wrapping, clearly does not know what he's doing.

I picked up a piece of yellowtail nigiri, dressed it up with some wasabi and dunked it in soy sauce. 

I popped the nigiri in my mouth and the first thing that hit me was the soy sauce. I have never had such cheap tasting, horribly salty soy sauce. I know soy is salty, but this was terrible. Pretty much any sushi place I've ever been to, upscale or divey, usually goes with the standard - plain old Kikkoman. I dont know what horribly cheap brand he was buying, but the salt was all I could taste, which as it turns out, was not such a bad thing.

I tried another piece of nigiri, no soy sauce this time. I nearly gagged. The fish was not only at room temperature (which was warm, considering the place had no a/c or circulation), but also was very, very obviously not fresh. 

Before I totally gave up (and because I was hungry), I tried a piece of crunchy shrimp roll. The shrimp was bland, the tempura not at all crispy or light and once again it was definitely not fresh seafood. The biggest offense with his roll, however, was the rice. The grains seemed bigger than they should be, making me think he was using regular long grain white rice, instead of the slightly more expensive sushi rice. Additionally, I found out part of the reason why his rolls are so sloppy, other than the over stuffing. When my roll fell to bits when picked up and when I tasted the rice, it was clear there was no vinegar in it, meaning it was not prepared correctly for sushi and therefore, not sticky rice in the least. Let me reiterate, this guy has no idea what he's doing.

I only had one or two whole pieces of his stuff before surrendering. The friend I was with, however, wasn't quite as critical as I was (and also didnt order nigiri, the most offensive part of the meal) and said I should box it up and he would eat it later. We took our stuff to Sam to be wrapped. He drilled us for a while: ""Where are you going after this? How far away is your house from here? Are you going to refrigerate this right away? You know this is RAW FISH, right?"". At first, I thought it was cute that he would care, but he made it clear pretty quickly what his motivation was - ""People get sick, they blame sushi restaurant. I not want to get sued! You could just go and leave in car all day. I have good restaurant! I not get in trouble for sick people!"" It was hilarious. He was mad about us maybe getting sick and suing him after a 10 minute ride in an air conditioned car, but he wasnt worried enough with food safety to serve properly stored, fresh fish.

Despite being a paying customer, I was treated as a nuisance and then given terrible food. Everyone says Sam's is the cheapest sushi it town. I wouldn't argue that. It's also pretty inexpensive.",2,"bad"
