"2","This place is super quaint and quiet. I love how clean and inviting it is. This is a B.Y.O.B and there is a beer distributor next door and a Shop-rite not too far down the strip mall that now sells beer and wine, incase you forget to bring wine or you randomly decide to go there for dinner. 

This place opened up about 6 months ago and I did get a menu in the mail but always forgot about it when playing the whats for dinner game. After running errands in the same location, I suggested trying this place out. I'm sad we did not try it sooner. They only have booths and tables, there is NO hibachi grill or show. 

We were greeted and sat right away, by the owner who us super sweet. She asked us for our drinks as we looked over our menu. I love that they bring out a tea pot for the table. A lot of places only bring you a cup and you need to ask for refills. 

I decided to try the garden salad with ginger dressing and a few sushi rolls off the 50% off menu. I tried the spicy tuna roll, sweet potato roll, pumpkin tempura roll and the Boston roll, which was lettuce, mayo and fresh shrimp. Hubby got the seafood hibachi meal. You could really see and taste a difference in this food versus other places. It was very fresh and delicious. You were not rushed and they really were attentive to our table and refills on drinks. 

They also offer a rewards program, where you earn credits based on your total bill. They save the amount you earned to be used next time or save it up for when you have $10 or more in credits. I believe its 5% of your total bill before taxes. 

I highly recommend this place!",1,"good"
"3","I don't write yelp reviews and this will be my first one; I decided to write for this place because I really enjoyed every experience I had here (got take out from here three times and ate in once with a friend). 

Atmosphere is nice and quiet and the service is friendly. The sushi is nice and fresh. I have not had their hibachi, but I have ordered a bunch of different rolls and sampled a lot of different nigiri sushi. Nothing I ever ordered from this place has made me sad and I would consider their sushi to be above average. Definitely try the pepper tuna and smoked salmon. 

What makes this place stand out from other sushi restaurants is the options they give you. The options for nigiri style sushi are great for everyone! Normally when I go to other sushi restaurants and order a nigiri style sushi entrée, it is the chef's decision on what kind of fish they want to give you, and most of the time it is a mixture of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, eel, shrimp, etc. If you are only trying to eat one kind of fish (such as salmon) or don't particularly like the others, then this place is terrific because they have entrees that include only one kind of fish (such as the salmon lovers or tuna lovers). I understand that you can order the type of fish you want piece by piece, but doing so is much more expensive than ordering an entire sushi entrée. They also have entrees that include a wide variety of different fish as well as some creative sushi and rolls I don't normally find in other good sushi places. 

Another thing that is great about this place is the deals they hook you up with. They give you 5 or 10% credit on your next meal if you spend $25 or $50 respectively, and their hibachi entrees are 40% off all day everyday whereas their rolls and sushi orders are 50% off. I plan to visit this place on a regular basis - they are extremely nice people and I hope they do well in their business.",2,"good"
