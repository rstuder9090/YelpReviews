"2","It has been quite a while since I've been to Tsunami. The atmosphere is exactly the same. It's still nice and comfortable. I can't remember why I stopped going, but I think it had something to do with slow service. The service was way better this time around. Len was super helpful and patient. He helped with seating mom comfortably in her chair, and boxed up her food at the end of the meal. It's the extra things that make us happy.

The menu must have changed somewhere in between 2006 and today. The specialty sushi roll menu in particular didn't jump out at me this time because a lot of the items contain cream cheese. I get it. Many people like the mixture of ingredients with cream cheese. I'm not one of them. I'm sure they would have excluded it if I asked, but felt I should point that out. The mussels appetizer is no longer TNT style. They are made in the chef's special Kunjun style. It was very good, and the mussels were large. I prefer the wasabi/Japanese mayo version over this one. With that said, it was still a welcomed change flavor-wise.

I've always liked their hibachi dishes. That's what we ordered. She got the shrimp and I got the shrimp & steak combo. It comes with a very generous portion of salad with ginger dressing. I love their ginger dressing! It's not that bright orange (almost artificial) dressing that I've had at other restaurants. I ate almost all of it. I could eat salad all day with this type of dressing. You also get a choice of miso or clear soup. The clear soup was average, but tasty. The dinner portions are a very good size. Everything was cooked very well. The fried rice had this very good smoky flavor from the wok. I think I detected a hint of oyster/fish sauce along with that great smoky taste. The shrimp and steak were of good quality. The yum yum sauce was on point. It was all very good. Definitely enough for 2 meals. We had leftovers. Oh, and the Moscato wine was very good as well as the hot green tea. They had other wine options as well. I think I'll try the German Riesling next time. I won't wait another 10 years to return.",1,"good"
"3","So many great things to say about this place! I left here super satisfied and can't wait to come back in the near future. I only wish this establishment was located closer to my home. 

The service: 
Our waitress was very kind and attentive. She fulfilled all our requests very quickly. Our food came out super quickly and super fresh. I don't know what happens in the kitchen but they are well prepared and didn't keep us waiting. 

The food:
I can't say enough great things about the food. Every single food item I received was delicious. I've been to a lot of sushi hibachi restaurants in the past but this is by far one of the best. I was provided with a large amount of salad and miso soup. The miso soup was delicious and full of flavor. Some places I've been the soup can taste quite watered down but not here. The sushi rolls were down right delicious. I've never had a peanut avocado roll but decided to give it a try and wasn't disappointed in the least. There is a huge selection of sushi rolls available. I am vegan and the others I was with are not. There was something for everyone and each person in my party enjoyed their meal. I am also very nervous about getting tofu in my hibachi. I just feel sometimes the tofu is spongy or not well prepared. However, I took a risk and got the tofu here and I am so happy I did! It was absolutely delectable! I just can't say enough wonderful things about this establishment!! The food was by far some of the best I've had.

The atmosphere:
The restaurant was clean and orderly. It was a nice relaxing atmosphere and overall pretty quiet. It's a nice setting for a family or even a medium sized party. We had 5 people in our party and were very comfortable. The parking lot was quite busy and it was a little hard finding parking on a Saturday evening. There are many other restaurants nearby so the area tends to be busy on the weekends. 

Overall:
This is a great establishment! The food, service and atmosphere are wonderful. If you are looking for a great sushi hibachi place look no further. This place has vegan options and they are very accommodating. This place is truly a gem!!",2,"good"
"4","I must say I was not impressed by this sushi restaurant. I have been waiting to hit a new spot so I could supply a whole new Yelp review, and this one is going to honestly be very negative.

First of all, let me just say that the interior of this establishment is very nice, the wall decorations and ceilings are decorated nicely, but once you get past that there is nothing good to say about Tsunami Sushi. A local supermaket, Publix, carries Tsunami sushi, and since it tastes so good at Publix, I assumed that the sushi would taste good at Tsunami sushi, and I was WRONG!

I had some eggrolls for an appetizer, which were decent, but nothing too special. You shouldn't bother paying the five dollars for them.

The sushi here was pretty bland, even my personal favorite the California, in freshness was not able to even remotely capture my taste buds at all. I tired some other rolls there like their Volcano Rolls and Philadelphia Rolls, but both were a disappointment and overall WASTE OF MONEY for the heavy price the restaurant charges.

My step-father, George Saunders, had their Korean Super Spicy dish and I must say that it was kickin'. I could smell it all the way from my side of the table, it left him feeling pretty sick the next day, but thats his own fault haha. 

Overall the bill was around $60, which wouldn't be bad if the sushi was great, but since it wasn't this place was a waste of time, and I would have been better off just going to Publix and buying the sushi from there! Big NO NO.",1,"bad"
"5","I've been here many times before. Normally I'd give them four stars. I was always provided excellent customer service and good sized rolls. I would usually order their firecracker or florida roll. Tonight, I decided to order to go and switch it up a bit. 

I ordered the tsunami wave (has crab, shrimp, and salmon) which is a specialty roll. I also ordered a Japanese bagel roll. The person who took my order over the phone repeated it back to me, so i knew he got the order correctly with my minor modification of leaving out the asparagus in the tsunami roll. All together, this was around $18. The order would be ready in fifteen minutes... Not bad at all. 

When i received the order, I thought it was weird that the bag was extremely light. While at a red light, I opened it and turned one of the rolls over and saw it was only crab inside. I decided to call tsunami sushi on the way home and told them of my concern. I overheard the server asking the sushi chef who made my order what he put inside. I even spoke with the manager. The manager said the three fishes were separated. Only 2 pieces per fish. I knew of some places that did that so I apologized for my confusion. I just didn't understand why a specialty would be the size of a regular roll on their menu. 

When I got home, I turned the apparant tsunami wave roll over. All crab. No other fish inside. I am really disappointed and it makes me not want to go back again. I understand mistakes happen since I used to work at a sushi restaurant myself, but I wish I wasn't lied to or they at least owned up to the mistake or took off $5 for the mistake. At this point, calling them again, to perhaps be lied to again is just not worth the trouble.",2,"bad"
