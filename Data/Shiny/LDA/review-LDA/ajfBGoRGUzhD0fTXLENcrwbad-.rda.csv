"2","What is this? A sushi restaurant on the Westbank that I haven't visited?? Impossible! I didn't even know this place was here until I went to Rotolo's a few months ago and a saw this little place next door. I made a mental note that I had to try this place for lunch.

I stopped in and, although it was around lunch time, it was pretty empty. I took a seat and the waitress immediately came over to help me. The first thing I saw on the menu was the noodle salad, and since I love noodle salad, I decided to start with that. When the noodle salad came out it looked...familiar. I had definitely met this salad before. THIS IS A TENNOU NOODLE SALAD!! I tasted it and yep- Tennou. I looked over the menu and everything was the same as Tennou. I had stumbled into Tennou 2.0! I don't know if it's the same owner or a former chef who owns the place or what, but I'm not complaining- I love Tennou and I'm actually super excited to find another one.

Since I was at Tennou 2, I decided to get my usuals because I know what I like: the Philly Roll and the Tiger Roll. The Tiger Roll is a favorite because it's tuna and salmon wrapped up in a roll with salmon and eel sauce on top. It's really good. I found both rolls here yummy and really fresh. The service was good and the waitress was attentive.

I am rarely in Belle Chasse, but I wouldn't hesitate to stop in here if I find myself in the area and looking for sushi.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I love this place! I think they had just opened when we got stationed here, and this was the first restaurant we went to, on our first night here before we had the kitchen unpacked. We love it! Their selection of sushi is expansive without being overwheming, and they have a good selection of Japanese dishes for those not fond of sushi. The first night we went I had the udon soup which was as delicious as it was massive, I took half of it home for the next day's lunch! My husband had the beef teriyaki bento box, and it was very good, as was the clear soup and salad it came with. I can't remember everything else we had, as that was a few months ago, but we sampled quite a bit of the various sushi offerings and they were all delicious! I love flying fish roe, and theirs was extremely fresh and fabulous! We also had a raw tuna salad that was absolutely amazing! Our waitress was very sweet and brought out a fork and training chopsticks for our 3 year old. 

We went again last night for my birthday dinner and, again, everything was fabulous! We started out with the gyoza, which was perfectly crisp on the bottom and tender throughout, and the dipping sauce was wonderful, I made sure to save it for my sashimi. I had the Chirasi bento box meal, with two to three pieces each of 7 different sashimi pieces, including octopus (This was a first for me, I love it!), salmon, tuna, and crab stick with seasoned rice topped with roe. I am not honestly certain what the other two were, they were white fleshed fish, I think one may have been swordfish. I'm not good at guessing unless they have a distinct appearance. The presentation was gorgeous with some of the fish rolled into rose shapes. Lovely. The dippind sauce from the goyoza was fab on the white fish, too! We also ordered the shrimp and avocado rolls, which were delish, and my husband had the beef teriyaki again, which was just as great as before! We both had the miso soup this time and it was very good! I wanted to get some red bean ice cream, as that is a favorite of mine, but our son was getting antsy, so we headed home. 

I must also add that they offer a military discount, which is always appreciated! We would definitely be here more often if we ate out of the house more (I just love to cook!), and will definitely keep coming back! My only complaint is that they don't carry Orion beer, which is one my husband drank a lot of while stationed in Japan, and he says is also very popular there. I also wish I didn't have to ask for a fork, as I am slightly chop stick handicapped, and it's a rather embarassing thing to have to ask for, so I wish they would be offered at the table along with the chopsticks. However, that is quickly remedied by asking for a fork for my son, hiding it, pretending it fell on the ground, and asking for another! ;)",2,"good"
"4","This place is pretty terrible. Food is awful and the service was even worse. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu. It took so long that I got to go menus to look at. It took another 5- 10 minutes for our drinks to come. When the food arrived, my salmon was burnt and came with a weird tasting teriyaki sauce. My husband couldn't even eat it so we sent it back. I didn't want to wait forever for another meal so I said I do not want anything else. I then specifically said I want it off the bill and she was fine with it at the time. When the bill came the waitress tried charging us for the salmon. I asked her why are we being charged and she said it was because I took a BITE out of it. I asked to speak to a manager. She went in the back and came to our table with a new bill without the salmon and without even saying a word to us. She was so rude. It's funny because we were always going to pay her 20 percent of the original bill but instead paid her a little more than 15 percent of the original bill which was still a pretty decent tip. She didn't even deserve that because of her poor attitude and very slow service. I will never come back here even if they paid me to eat here.",1,"bad"
"5","I just dined in here a few hours ago. Since the other sushi places were closed, my husband and I decided to come here. When we first came inside the restaurant, it was dead empty and we were the only customers. After deciding where we want to sit, we were greeted by a server. The server, with no menu in her hands, asked us what you would we like to drink. It was kinda awkward because, well you know, can I look at the drink menu first and see what you guys have? So I just ordered a Sprite. The server left and came back with some menus for us. We placed an order and waited. Then, the food finally came and we consumed it. We didn't eat much, so there was leftovers that can fit at least a big togo box. We asked for a box and the server gave us a small Togo box. We packed our food and the small Togo box didn't fit all the food. So we HAVE to ask for another small box!? At this point I am already annoyed. Either the restaurant is cheap or that server lacks common sense. Honestly, thinking about it, we were the only customers there and they still provide bad service. Some were glued to their phone all the time. Now on to the food. It is not impressive either. The avocados in our rolls are almost rotten. It was 75% brown. The fish are stale....",2,"bad"
