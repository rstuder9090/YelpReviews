"2","This is a good sushi place but Hiroba Sushi is still my favorite.
At first I was going to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, since some of what they're doing at Ricksaw Sushi Kwon does at Hiroba: Gravlax, appetizers included with all you can eat, cucumbers along with ginger to cleanse the palate and a few other things.
Then I remembered that Kwon was hired to turn the original Rickshaw at Kietzke and South Virginia from a Chinese food place to a sushi place, so I'm not sure how much may be left from his time working there.
One nice addition to the appetizers at Rickshaw I don't remember seeing any place else is a small salad. I think it comes with a sesame dressing. You eat it with chopsticks.
The mussels are spicier at Rickshaw sushi, which I also liked.
I ordered unagi to start because it's kind of a litmus test dish. If it's old it tastes fishy and their unagi was fresh and delicious. The tamago, or scrambled egg, wasn't that good and may have been old. it was kind of a stumble.
Also I had to try their Gravlax, since I love this at Hiroba. I didn't like their as much as Hiroba's gravlax. I usually get a reorder at Hiroba but I passed at Rickshaw.
Next came the upside down shrimp and this was excellent. The seared maguro was kind of a stumble, though. I didn't like the flavor.
Next came the Lulu roll and this was probably my favorite sushi of the meal. Lots of great flavors. I decided to try the shrimp balls appetizer and it was okay. It didn't seem to be the best quality shrimp.  I tried a crab (kani) to finish and it was bland.
For dessert, the sushi chef made me something out of an orange that was a beautiful presentation and also quite delicious.
Overall the meal was good and I have no problem going to Rickshaw sushi again.
The original restaurant was called Rickshaw Paddy's or something like that and it opened in the 1990s. The owner, Rick Shaw, had traveled in Asia and he offered pan-Asian cuisine, including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai and I think there was an Asian Indian dish on the menu. He was also of Irish descent so he also offered corned beef and cabbage and boiled potatoes. As I recall the logo was of a leprechaun pulling a rickshaw.
The food was so so. The restaurant did better with the Japanese and Chinese dishes. The pud thai was bad and the Korean short ribs were heavily drenched in soy sauce, not the sauce you typically see on Korean food. I think they were prepared as Japanese ribs and then slightly altered and called Korean.
Rick Shaw sold the restaurant and a subsequent owner changed it to Chinese only food. I tried it once and I've got to say it was a contender for one of the 10 worst restaurants in Reno. I got a chicken dish and the meat was not identified as chicken or anything other than some sort of protein substance. I felt like I needed a tetanus shot after eating there.
The owner eventually brought in Kwon, remodeled it into a sushi restaurant and that's when I met Kwon. I think he left after about a year to start Hiroba Sushi.
This new location of Rickshaw Sushi is doing well. The owners have gotten a talented staff and they're buying good quality fish. I hope Reno rewards them with financial success.",1,"good"
"3","This place is definitely my new favorite sushi spot in Reno. 

The lowdown;

Fish; Good quality, fresh (it is noticeably better than many other spots in Reno)

Rolls; Great selection of long rolls, nigiri, hand rolls. They do use quite a bit of sauce (and sesame seeds which a friend of mine did not care for) so if that isn't your thing, I would ask for light or none. 

They do a good job to accommodate requests such as additions or subtractions to rolls at no extra cost. They seem to always have an awesome special roll of the day. Free bottle of sake on Saturday.

Atmosphere; This place is off the beaten track and doesn't get any tourist traffic so it stays relatively quiet. It might get busy but I have never seen it. 

It's always a little weird (in a good way I think) as they don't really put music on. They do have TV's but last time I was there, they were watching some bad WWII movie where Americans were battling Japanese (which is a bit strange for a restaurant, no less a Japanese restaurant). Maybe it's just me, I thought it was funny. 

The chefs are really friendly but do not speak the best English.

The lunch price is the best deal as you get about 90% of the rolls on the menu for 60% of the dinner price.

All in all, I love it. Great food, great price for AYCE, and you always leave really full.",2,"good"
