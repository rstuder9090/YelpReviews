"2","Watch out, kids.  There's a new sushi bully on the block.  I had sushi from Sakana several months ago, and it was good.  When I heard the ownership had changed, I jumped to test it out.  Who was Jay?  Did I care what his favorite sushi bar was?  The first night I was pleasantly surprised.   I ordered again two nights later.  It tasted better.  Tonight was my sixth order over the past few weeks, and I sit at my computer with the taste of the sea lingering on my palate.  The seaweed salad was fine, as was the soup, but it is with the quality of the fish, the deft touch of the gentlemen behind the bar and its incredible value that make this a five star restaurant.  The sashimi platter brought ruby-fleshed tuna, at perfect temperature, along side yellowtail snapper so rich I felt like I had my tongue in a vat of butter.  Albacore, or white tuna, at its worst takes like salt and a piece of turkey that's five days past its prime.  At its best, its pure flavor, creamy and savory with a touch of umami, can elevate the tongue through the stratosphere.  At Jay's Favorite, it is fish in its prime.  As is the salmon.  It tastes so fresh, I feel like I could be eating on some boat in Alaska where it was caught minutes before.  It may be farmed.  I don't know.  It tastes fantastic, though.  There is crab stick on the plate as well.  I happen to like this, though I have never seen it before on a sashimi plate.  The yellowtail roll I ordered was well made.  The rice was very good; and again, the fish was as delicate as a young flower, certainly feeling the savory sting of the chopped scallions but able to hold her own, creating perfect harmony within the walls of seaweed.  I rounded out my order with with 2 pieces of wasabi tobiko sushi. (I had ordered mackerel nigiri in the past, the fish demonstrating the perfect ratio of vinegary tang and oils.)  The wasabi tobiko was the weak point of the night owning to its surprising lack of horseradish bite.  When I eat a heap of wasabi tobiko, I want my nose to run and my brain to release a surge of endorphins because it is so hot.  I didn't feel any of that.   Still, the meal as whole is easily 5-star worthy.  I would pay Chestnut street prices for sushi this good.  Yet I don't have to, as Jay also knows his value.  There are a ton of special rolls on the menu, yet I have not indulged.  Alas, I wrestle with a full-sized spare tire, the only redeeming feature of which is it draws attention away from my several chins.  However, the deep-fried, tempura flaked,  cream cheese stuffed bites of heaven may prove more than I can resist.",1,"good"
"3","If you liked Vic's in the OLD Days (when Vic & his wife first opened) you'll like Jay's.  Jay (and Martin) worked with Vic for a while.  Many of the crazy (and a bit over-sauced - get your sauce on the side - problem solved), calorie-laden specialty rolls are just like Vic's but sub lobster for crab and have different names.

My first visit (a few minutes ago) I ordered 2 things - tuna dumplings (divine) - and the eggplant lady.

Both are apps. - but that was just perfect for little ole me.

The $7.50 order of 2 hand-flattened tuna pouches came bursting with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy mixture of lobster (real) and crab (fake) salad with masago and avocado.  Creamy, fattening, non-traditional goodness.

The $4.25 eggplant lady (I will re-order this for sure) had 2crispy-thin tempura slices of purple japanese eggplant.  The eggplant was luscious, crisp slice was topped with chopped shrimp and (fake) crab salad (more avocado, masago, kewpie - like my hips needed THAT!), topped with sliver-sliced avo and eel sauce.

(Next time - no sauce.)

This is NOT a place to get traditional nigiri.  (The tamago is frozen, and there's no way that Inari is home made)  It is a place for ""fun-food"" rolls as a treat.  Purists won't like it, but Phat-Philly types should LOVE it here.

The service was Excellent - but Jay is new and eager to please.  I anticipate visiting againsoon - and I'd bet money on it that the 6-seat sushi bar (and tables for about 14 more - It's bigger than Vic's - andthey actually serve you your drinks) will be MUCH more crowded.

So in summary:  Sushi-newbie?  Great place for you.  Fresh-fish, sashimi purist?  Probably not.

For me - there is a time and place for everything.  Tonight was my time for the 2 month old Jay's.

I sure hope the quality doesn't deteriorate in 6 months.",2,"good"
