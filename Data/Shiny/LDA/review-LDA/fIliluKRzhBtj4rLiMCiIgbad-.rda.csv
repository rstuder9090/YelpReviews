"2","As I preface any review of a Chinese restaurant, I grew up in NY with some of the best Chinese food in NY city. I usually only go to and review places with a menu of traditional dishes I grew up with. One place that has a nice menu is Trey Yan and Wu. Right off the bat I noticed a number of my favorite dishes. Granted they may be a little more on the pricey side but worth it to get the quality and flavor of delicious dishes without having to go to NYC or Philadelphia.
 
We had a table of 5 adults and 2 small children and service was impeccable and the servers very friendly. We started with the Pink Lady and Bossy Lady sushi rolls as appetizers. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the teriyaki beef skewers. My skewer was tender beef but one person did complain her piece was a little chewy but she was the only one. Still great flavor.
 
Can't complain about any dish we got. Everyone, including friends who never had these dishes before loved them ... beef chow fun, beef pan fried noodles (one of my all-time favorite dishes and hard to find), peking duck, and saut√©ed baby bok choy with garlic. The one pricey item was the peking duck at $20 with 6 crepes, the table absolutely loved it but I would have liked to have gotten more meat from a half duck but not complaining too much. The skin was crispy and the meat tender. One dish the table decided to try was the honey walnut shrimp. It was good but not worth $20 to me.
 
Overall a very pleasant and delicious outing and would highly recommend for those who want to try some different Chinese dishes not found in every chinese restaurant.",1,"good"
"3","Dear uneducated, racist/ignorant people that just casually surf Yelp without knowing the difference between Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Thai food:

In case you haven't noticed, this restaurant is owned by Cantonese-speaking Chinese people and predominantly serve food inspired by the Sinitic mainland. Sure, restaurants nowadays like to capitalize on the fact that most Americans that have never been abroad cannot distinguish between what's authentic and what's watered-down and offer dishes that are slightly outside of their taste palate (e.g. Chinese/Korean restaurants that serve Japanese food; Chinese ""pho"" restaurants, etc.) but if you're a smart consumer, you don't go into McDonalds and order the salad and expect for it to be the best thing in the world. Or go to Olive Garden and expect the pizza/tomato pie to be better than LL Spumoni's or Uno's (the real one in Chicago, not the grille franchise)

That being said, one should know better than to be ignorant enough to order Sushi/sashimi from a Chinese restaurant and have an epiphany regarding the futility of said act, and then try to mask the newfound shame through an uninformative, lackluster Yelp review centered on loaded and negative phrases.

Now that I'm done being a Negative Nancy, on to the actual review.

I don't quite know what part about this restaurant is very yan and what part of it is wu, but it seems to be working well for the restaurant itself. Yes, the restaurant is slightly pricier than your run-of-the-mill delivery/takeout Chinese restaurant, and to miss the fact that TY&W is not one of the aforementioned establishments, you'd be a square. The interior of the restaurant is very well decorated, and has the air of elegance to it; all the wait staff don white button-up shirts and trim black pants, which did make me feel slightly underdressed, but they didn't seem to mind it anyhow.

Service was excellent and on that note, to people that complain about the lack of service or the quality of service in Chinese restaurants: if you ever go to China, to get any service in ANY restaurant period (save the ones frequented by the upper/middle class) you have to yell ""Waiter/Waitress"" and yell at the top of your lungs and pray to dog they heard you. It's actually kind of like a bar -- you try your darndest to establish eye contact and communiation with your server and then pray to Buddha that you don't end up with the runs within the next two hours. 

In any case, the waitress was very friendly and attentive to our culinary needs.

The food here--so long as you figure out that they're a Chinese restaurant and you should order things that Chinese people like to eat--is outstanding. We ordered the eggplant, stir-fried bok choy in ginger/garlic sauce, (which was replaced with Chinese cauliflower because they ran out of bok choy) beef and scallops in pepper sauce, and because I was at dinner with non-Asian people, Thai Shrimp. The chef was also more than willing to cook up an egg and scallion fried rice for us even though it wasn't on the menu, which, along with the rest of the meal, was probably some of the best Chinese food I'd had in Jersey.

TY&W probably benefits from the fact that they're located in Mount Laurel, NJ and not Philly Chinatown, but it's a solid choice if you love Chinese food and are tired of eating it out of silly paper/styrofoam containers.

Oh, and BYOB.",2,"good"
"4","A year and a half ago, I had a lunch here that has run through my mind over and over again, especially on those nights when my Chinese food cravings were really strong. It was a perfect lunch. Shrimp with vegetables (probably garlic sauce) and wonton soup. It was expensive, but you could tell it was high quality food, which is how I have felt previous times I have been here. I have waited all of this time to have that meal again, especially since this restaurant did not do curbside pickup , so we had to wait until we were comfortably vaccinated to go inside to do takeout. So for my Mother's Day gift I asked my husband if we could order from here. We waited until tonight because we thought it would have been too crowded on Mother's Day weekend. This was a very anticipated meal. Sadly, I was sooooo disappointed. Where to start? The Chinese pizza was hard, chewy and slightly burnt. To add insult to injury, it only came with a tiny bit of the sweet sauce to dip it in. The crab rangoon....where's the crab? Seriously, I took one apart with my fingers to examine it and look for the crab. I think the crab got away on that one, and all of them! My wonton soup had a weird metallic taste to the broth. My husband's salmon teriyaki was fine. Nothing horrible there. However, my shrimp with vegetables.....first of all, I clearly ordered wrong because I remembered a tasty brown sauce. I tried not to hold my mistake against the dish, but it just could not be liked. In some parts, it was super watery and in others it was congealed gobs on the veggies. The shrimp were a nice size, but they had a strange taste to them. I have never had to throw shrimp away, but I threw most of it in the trash. Tres Yan & Wu, I beg of you. You can do better. You HAVE to give me better quality food than the cheap Chinese takeout around the corner that I can get for half the price, and that tastes better than what you gave me tonight! Please! I am hoping that this is just a product of covid issues that have hit the restaurant industry so terribly and that you will rise to what I know you can do as things get better. Meanwhile, I need to take a break from you. Not a breakup, just a break.... I hope.",1,"bad"

This place has the lowest, most vulgar owner imaginable.   I went with high hopes, based upon all the other reviewers.  My husband and I were seated immediately, but waited ten minutes to get water, and then had to remind the staff that we were waiting to order.  The waiter which came to take our order had a slight attitude problem, so things were really not starting out well here.  We made it through the soup course -- one quite good and one so-so.    Our appetizers came out of the kitchen -- lukewarm to cold.  The ""crab puffs"" were slightly less than room temperature and filled with cream cheese, no crab inside.     I noticed my husband's honey glazed ribs were pink -- not the red food dye that appears on the outside and turns to black, but inside right next to the bone.   They were also cold.   We called the waiter over, told him the crab puffs were cold; we were not loud or angry or the least bit rude.  We were not hungry as the soup had been satisfying.   He did not have sufficient command of English to make himself understood but started arguing about the cream cheese portion of the dish.  Then we told him the ribs were pink --REMEMBER FOLKS, THIS IS PORK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.  He brought the owner over to our table.  Whatever happened to the customer is always right?   This IGNORANT pregnant woman starts yelling at us and arguing as if she was at trial.  She said ""I'm pregnant, and I'd eat these"", picks up a rib off of OUR PLATE WITH HER HANDS, and then puts it back down.   She was relentless and continued to argue, as opposed to just offering us another dish.   Then she picks the rib back up off the plate and takes a bite of it and chews it like an ape with her mouth open.   Well, we were both speechless and could not believe it.   THIS WAS THE SORT OF THING YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE ON SEINFELD OR ON A SITCOM.   But no, it was taking place right in front of my eyes, this supposedly sophisticated owner of a 4-star restaurant just used her dirty fingers to eat the food off my plate!!!!   Well, eventually she agreed to take the ribs and crab puffs off the bill, we finished our dinner w/the main courses and left.  I  have NEVER dreamed of an owner doing this.   This place is NOT what people say it is.  I wish I had a picture.   I asked her to come back and let me take a picture of her when the next course arrived ... do you she refused to eat the food before I did?   I wonder what they did to it in the kitchen!!!   The food was pretty good, and might be impressive to those without a sophisticated palate, but  not impress me.   I've got a wonderful place on Union Mill Road, Mt. Laurel that does Thai, Chinese and Japanese near me for 1/3 the price, I'll definitely be staying with them for the future.
