"2","Man.. I was craving sushi really badly, so I decided to order from the nearest place (so I could pick it up) from grubhub. I've been to Japan so I know how wide the spectrum of sushi can be (good and bad). Being in Philly, I was expecting it to be mediocre at best.

I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 3-roll lunch for $10.95 because it was a good deal and I didn't trust the place's sushi quality to order any expensive special rolls: spicy salmon, salmon avocado, and shrimp tempura. It comes with either miso soup or salad. The soup was watery, but it was something warm to drink while I digged in.Their rolls maybe look a little smaller than average, but I think that's because they put minimal rice around the outside, which is what I like, anyway.

The good part is, they did not skimp out on the meat! There was a nice, fresh slab of salmon hugging each avocado piece in the salmon avocado roll. Their shrimp tempura roll is only 5 pieces, but they are a lot bigger, with avocado, cucumber, and 2 shrimp pieces in each piece (a lot of places make rolls only 1 shrimp thick, stuffing the rest with the panko they fry it in).

The only bad thing was the spicy salmon. It wasn't spicy at all; actually, I didn't taste any sauce on it whatsoever. It was basically just minced salmon mixed with some panko. I've seen panko added to spicy tuna/salmon rolls in other restaurants to give the roll a nice crunch, but in this case, it was just mushed up with the fish and didn't add anything to it.

Good portion sizes. I can eat a lot, but I was absolutely stuffed after eating the 3 rolls. Service was also great. For that, it gets 4 stars.

TLDR; did it satisfy my craving? Yes. Will I be going back? Yes, for the lunch special maki rolls. I just won't get the spicy salmon/tuna.",1,"good"

-----

On a random weekend night, the GF and I felt checking out another Philly sushi spot for delivery. We settled upon Kabuki Sushi. 

Sushi Regular Entree [$15.95]
Seven pieces of assorted sushi, California roll, miso soup, house salad

With the sushi regular entree, we received some miso soup, which was fairly standard - briny with bits of tofu and scallion within. The house salad came with some tomatoes, Iceberg lettuce, and julienned strips of carrot, along with some of that prototypical ginger dressing. 

For the sushi, we actually received nigiri, which included fatty white tuna (I know it's bad for you, but I love it!), meaty yellowtail, snappy striped bass, fatty salmon, fresh tuna, and a California roll. The rice was lightly warm and had a sweet vinegary seasoning that didn't overpower the fish. Not bad for delivery! 
 
Philadelphia Roll [$5.25]
Smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado

I love a good Philly roll and this didn't disappoint. Basically bagels and lox without the cure, the fattiness of the salmon, avocado, and cream cheese obviously went well together. 

New York Roll [$12.95]
Spicy salmon, tuna crunchy, avocado roll, topped with spicy tuna, salmon, flying fish roe, scallion, wasabi sauce.  

Their specialty NY roll was a contrast in spicy salmon, which was cooled off by the creamy avocado. I appreciated the crunch of the tuna and the briny pop of masago. 

Volcano Roll [$9.95]
Tempura rice roll topped with spicy tuna, chef's sauce

The volcano roll was especially gluttonous and overdone with mayo on top of the spicy tuna. Americanized sushi exemplified. 

Sweet Potato Roll [$4.95] 

You know we had to order our standard sweet potato roll. Sadly, the sweet potato was still a bit starchy and the tempura crunch was just not there. 
 
Overall, the nigiri were good at Kabuki, especially for delivery. But there were a few misses as well. Still, if you're looking for takeout or delivery, I'd give them a try - the order got to our door within 30 minutes!",2,"good"
