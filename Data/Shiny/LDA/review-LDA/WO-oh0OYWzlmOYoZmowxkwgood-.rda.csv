"2","Seriously?  No one has reviewed Wasabi yet?  No one has declared the delights of the dynamite roll?  Not a single salutation of the sirloin?  No astonishment at my abundance of aimless alliteration?

And for crying out loud...the Yum Yum sauce, people.  WHAT ABOUT THE YUM YUM SAUCE?!

Sorry about that.  In all seriousness, I really do adore this place.  I mean, granted, if you've been to one hibachi place, you've been to most all of them.  What's that?  On onion volcano?  I never would have expected that...

What set's Wasabi apart are two things.  One, the joyful quirkiness of the hibachi cooks.  One puts out his onion-cano fire using a slightly naughty little boy figurine that shoots a stream of water from his...well...boy bits.

Then there's the very Asian hibachi chef who has perfected an extremely spot on, just twisted enough version of a ""southern"" accent.  Wonderful.

The second thing that sets Wasabi apart.  The sushi.  Specifically the dynamite roll (will not make ""Good Times"" joke...will not make ""Good Times"" joke).  Seriously, though, it lives up to it's name.

Oh, and if you go, check out the faucets in the bathrooms.  For some reason, they fascinated me.  I know, you were with me right up to this point.  But this is my review.  And if I wanna proselytize the plumbing, I will, darn it.",1,"good"
"3","I've been to lots of hibachi restaurants and this one is probably the best! We went during lunch, so it was cheap AND good. Everything was so fresh; the vegetables and rice and meat were all cooked perfectly and were of a good quality and you get a lot, portion-wise. They have this red pepper sauce that is a little spicy, a little sweet and I swear, it's SO good we bought some to-go and used it on lamb shawarma later! I'm a big fan. They set the bar high, so now I'm gonna have a hard time going to hibachi places that don't stack up! :/",2,"good"
