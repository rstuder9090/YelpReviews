"2","I'm not sure whether to review CDB's or Sake House, so I'll review both. With only one entrance, we chose to sit on the Sake House side and order both pizza & sushi. We asked to sit in a booth, and were easily accommodated as the restaurant wasn't busy on this Friday night. Our server was quick to greet us & take our drink order.

First, drinks are 2 for 1, all the time! I ordered sangria, and our sever asked if I wanted half a shot of brandy in it, for no extra charge. Yes, please! Howard had whiskey with a Pepsi chaser. My two sangrias totalled $6, and Howard's two whiskey shots were $5.50 - what a deal, and they were a good size! 

Initially, we only ordered two California Rolls, because Howard was impatient to order. After we looked at the menu, we decided to get the $12.99 dinner special any 2 rolls among 40 options, plus a miso soup & house salad. Our young server was not flustered one bit by this change, although the kitchen was and one of the California rolls came out much later. The house salad was good, with lots of very fresh lettuce. Our server told us the ginger dressing was made in-house, and while it was good, I didn't really like the flavor. The miso soup, however, was fabulous! Not too salty, yet quite flavorful.

The three of us shared a Spider Roll & two California Rolls, and we all agreed they were excellent. The rolls were large & plumply filled. In fact, my daughter, a sushi enthusiast, said the quality & flavor was better than most other sushi restaurants she frequents. 

I was not impressed with the cheese pizza we ordered. While I'm not a tomato sauce fan, this pizza had nearly no sauce at all. It tasted like a giant round cheesy bread. I certainly expected better from CDB's. Plenty of cheese, and it WAS good, but this wasn't really a pizza.

We enjoyed our evening at CDB's/Sake House, and we'll definitely return for the sushi & drinks... And maybe we'll try another pizza.",1,"good"
"3","Sake House is my favorite place to get sushi because it is so darn inexpensive. The lunch special (2 rolls, miso soup, and ginger salad) is about $8, which is so cheap! The dinner deal is only $4 more, starting after 3:30pm. There is a bit of a hit in quality, like with service time, but overall, it is very fun to come here. The atmosphere is very enjoyable in my opinion (just a little loud sometimes with CDB right next door).
My favorite roll is the sweet potato roll. I love the cream cheese inside paired with the fried sweet potato. It all will melt in your mouth! I am not a huge fan of the veggie roll, but you can asked for it tempura style, and it tastes amazing. They easily have taken special requests when I ask for things like tempura style or add cream cheese on rolls.
Back when I ate fish, my favorite roll was the 2011 roll. The combination of the salmon and cream cheese tempura style is out of this world! You should definitely try this roll when you come here.
I enjoy the convenience of this restaurant (right next to USF) as well as the hours and the prices of sushi here. As well, I've always found it easy to place an order online for food. They have a pick-up option, so all you have to do is fill out the order form online, wait about 20-30 minutes, and drop by to pay and pick up your food. It's super convenient for someone craving sushi with a busy schedule not wanting to wait in the restaurant for too long.
I know I saw some other people say they prefer other sushi places, and I have tried a few others myself, but I have always liked the sushi I've had at Sake House best, and will continue to come here as a first choice.",2,"good"
