"2","I went to Shanghai station on a Saturday evening with my girlfriend. It's an underground space which looks tiny from outside, but is deceptively bigger. We got seated right away since there weren't many people at the time. The waitress was very nice and prompt in taking our order. We ordered pork soup dumplings, kung pao chicken with hand drawn noodles, and chili cabbage shredded pork noodles. We were super hungry so were happy to see the food come quickly (under 10m). For some reason, all the dishes came in the noodle soup form. I'm not sure if that's how it was supposed to come or there was some miscommunication during ordering. The soup dumplings were super hot and a little difficult to eat, but I blame my lack of soup-dumpling-eating skills for that. They they were delicious. The same can be said about the cabbage dish though the soup broth was a little low on spice (but not flavor) for my taste. But then again, I like really spicy things. Kung pao was also very delicious and was spicy enough to bring me to tears (yes, that's the way I like it). The waitress was always around to ask if we needed anything. In the end, she brought us the check upon asking. We had some leftover kung pao which she very skillfully poured into a takeout container in front of us, without spilling even a drop of the delish soup. Upon being complimented for her superior pouring skills, she told us that she was trained to do this during  her job at a pho restaurant. Way to go! 

Anyway, the overall experience was great, food was cheap and delicious. Portions are decently sized. One appetizer and two entrees were more than enough food for two really hungry people. I would definitely recommend this place to people, specially living in university city, looking for good Chinese food. Soup dumplings are a must, so don't miss out on those.",1,"good"
"3","So glad to have this new option in university city for Chinese food! (most other alternatives serve greasy, overly saucey Chinese food)

Shanghai Station's entrance is down a flight of stairs and the restaurant itself is situated under a hairdresser / subway. Nara used to be there, known for their sake bombs and drunken college nights (or so I've heard); Shanghai Station seems to want to keep up the drinking part of it, heavily advertising their drink specials and with a darkish interior decor interspersed with disco-y lights. Wasn't expecting too much of the food, especially since they seem to be, as a restaurant, more focused on their alcohol selection, but I was so pleasantly surprised with their food.

To preface my later comments about service of the restaurant and for context: we came in a huge group of 20 people. We ordered the pork soup dumplings (小籠包), the crab meat soup dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, Chinese broccoli, broccoli with beef, shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes and crystal shrimp. 

Highlights: 
Pork soup dumplings - they were absolutely delicious! Each order comes with 6 dumplings, and it came out steaming hot. My usual pet peeve with these kinds of dumplings (and I'm pretty picky with them because I was spoiled with good food in Hong Kong) is when they have super thick dumpling skins. It was not the case with these - the wrappers were delicate and thin, holding the hot, rich soup that spurts out when you bite into them. Would highly recommend! My only complaint would be that they didn't bring out the vinegar dipping sauce with this dish, but make sure you ask for it because a soup dumpling would not be complete without a dash of vinegar and thin ginger strands.

Crab soup dumplings - basically same as above, but with a distinct crab flavor. 

Dan Dan noodles - they used a softer type of noodle to make this dish compared to the usual type, and I have mixed feelings about it. Taste was solid though, but I'd suggest going to the Sichuan restaurants if you really crave the authentic type of Dan Dan noodles.

Chinese broccoli - this type of vegetable (芥蘭) is probably one of my favorite types of vegetables, and it bears little resemblance to broccoli, so the name might be confusing. It's lightly sautéed in garlic, nothing too fancy but really good. Serving size is a little small though! 

Service - the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly, but we waited a long long time for the other dishes. We were in a huge group and they just opened, so I wouldn't hold it against them too much. Throughout the meal the servers were also pretty good at refilling water during the wait. 

All in all, a good, affordable option for some good Chinese food! Definitely get the soup dumplings, the crystal shrimp / broccoli with beef were alright but I'd recommend trying other dishes since they have a pretty expansive menu!",2,"good"
