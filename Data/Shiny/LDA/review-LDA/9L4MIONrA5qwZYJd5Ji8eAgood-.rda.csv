"2","I am a HUGE Tokyo Mandarin fan.   I used to go all the time when I was in college because I was always over at my best friend's house and she lives five minutes away, but I unfortunately haven't been there lately because I now have a 9-5 and am usually not in her area on weekends.  I sure do miss it!

Most dishes at Tokyo Mandarin are Chinese or Japanese, with a few Thai options thrown in for good measure.  Every dish my friend, her parents, and I have tried gets a positive rating because each is well-above average.  There are plenty of dishes to choose from. We always leave the restaurant feeling deeply satisfied.

The only semi-negative thing about Tokyo Mandarin in Swedesboro is that the dining area is tiny.  The dining area at Tokyo Mandarin in Glassboro is double the size of the one in Swedesboro.

If you are coming to the restaraunt in Swedesboro to dine on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait.  (I do not know if they take reservations.  You're better off doing take-out on a weekend night if all you are interested in is Asian food and not a dining experience.) There are maybe ten tables, and the quarters can be cramped.  If you and your dinner date are planning on having a top secret discussion over a meal, don't do it here - if the restaurant is busy, your neighbors will be almost on top of you and be able to hear everything if they want.  Also, there isn't a bar, but it is BYOB.

With that said, I am still giving Tokyo Mandarin five stars for two reasons
.
First, you can't beat their lunch specials.  You can get a generously portioned Bento Box (among other things) with soup and salad for under $10.

Secondly, I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER had Pad Thai that comes anywhere near the deliciousness level of Tokyo Mandarin's.  Pad Thai is one of my all-time favorite dishes.  Their spicy chicken Pad Thai is absolutely to die for. If you are a Pad Thai fan and haven't tried Tokyo Mandarin's, you have absolutely no idea what you are missing!",1,"good"
"3","4 stars for a South Jersey Chinese/Japanese food establishment. Now if it was in Chinatown in Philly it would be a 3 star.
The had a small dinning room but since Covid they no longer offer any on-site dinning options.
I'm not going to say they are rude because I think it's just a cultural difference.  They definitely know their regular customers, they don't make ya feel all fuzzy and warm but they aren't rude or mean.  They have a job, which is providing good food and they do that job well.
If your looking for the type of Chinese establishment that serves the big greasy chicken wings and the underwhelming fried rice, your not going to get that here.
In my experience the food is always fresh and still very hot by the time we get home.  They have sushi which is fresh and tasty.  If you don't like raw then ask for the Cindy Holiday roll, it's not on the menu, a friend told me about it.  It's shrimp tempura roll with some flair! 
My kids are just getting the taste for Chinese so they stick to steamed dumplings and fried rice. 
Never had a wait time longer than 15 minutes, average time of course is 10 minutes.(someone please tell me how,  that no matter what you order, most Chinese places can get it ready in 10 minutes )
Unfortunately, they don't offer delivery but if you can't get a ride you can get delivery using DoorDash",2,"good"
