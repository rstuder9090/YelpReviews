"2","(3.5, rounded up)On a busy Friday night at 6pm, here's my dinner experience of 2. 

-The Good: 
1)Quick polite service: Though busy, we felt we were taken care of. 
2)Crab Rangoon was crispy and filling. Hibachi Chicken. Portion sizes were excellent. The Yum-Yum sauce is really good, with a minor spicy twist. Sushi was good and menu is expansive.  ($4.50 for 6 pieces)!
3) Atmosphere: It was clean and mostly quiet. There was a bustle about the place, but overall it was an enjoyable evening. 

The Meh:
1) The Miso Soup was average at best (not much flavor, overly salty). 
2) The fried rice was okay. Again, not much flavor. 

-The Bad:
1) My wife ordered the filet mignon ""medium"" but it came back very rare. We asked our waitress to take it back and cook it longer because we ordered ""medium"". The second time it came back, it was also rare again. We asked for a plate of chicken instead and didn't touch the steak. So be aware of the steak doneness!! We were scared of the chicken doneness as well after this. It really detracted from our experience. 

Summary: Almost everything we had was good, but not excellent, in a surprisingly pleasant atmosphere. Being brand new, this place has potential to be excellent.",1,"good"
"3","So I ended up here by accident. Yelp or my map app was having quite the off night because after a business meeting in the general area of this restaurant I clicked ""get directions"" to about 4 places from yelp only to ""arrive"" -- and find the restaurant nowhere in sight. So I decided to eat at the very next non fast-food place I saw and this is where I ended up.
And...it was pretty, pretty good. I was famished after a long day and opted for a sushi appetizer--the crazy roll--and a vegetable pad Thai plate.
The sushi was excellent: great flavor and texture, delicious sauce and while it's not usually the kind of thing I pay much attention to it was plated excellently, just really pretty to even look at.
I devoured that with a (decently priced) beer and waited on the pad thai. Which was not bad though not as great as the sushi. I've never had pad thai that wasn't at least somewhat spicy but this one had no heat and the noodles were just a tad on the mushy side. Other than that the flavor was really good and the portion was generous particularly for the price.
All in all a good find and I'm glad I ended up here. I was here on a weeknight and it was an enormous place that was very sparsely attended so hopefully other folks discover this place soon.",2,"good"
