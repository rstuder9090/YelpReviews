"2","This was the first time we ordered from JJ Asian Cuisine.  Wanted to try a new Chinese restaurant and were pleasantly surprised to find Thai food on the menu as well as Japanese.  The hot and sour soup we ordered was good, tasted the sour but the ""hot"" needed to be kicked up a bit.  Egg rolls tasted OK but were a bit thin. Vegetable Moo Sho was good (hoisin sauce was kind of runny) and the Thia red curry w/chicken, fried tofu and vegetables was very good.

At this time, take out only. Overall, driving from Skippack was worth the trip. Food was ready and precautions in place at this time were appreciated.  Will go back.",1,"good"
"3","I have to question how genuine ""Andrew V."" is in his review. He criticizes the kung pao as both flavorless and ""overloaded with onion"".  I don't understand how you can have both of those in the same dish? Onion is ONLY flavor?.. 3/30/14, A Sunday night, at 9pm I ordered it. If I were to get a ""disappointing"" order, I'd assume it would be this time of night. A hour before closing on a Sunday. I ordered Kung pao and steamed vegetables to go. It was ready in 15 as they said, and both were above average. Kung pao was not spicy enough for those seeking the ""spicy sweats"" but did supply a very noticeable, slow, burn on the back end. Next time I would request to have some hot peppers added, but that's to my specific palate. The steam veggies and tofu that came with it were both fine. This was my first meal from JJ and will be my next as well, when I am looking for Asian cuisine in Harleysville. Most likely some sushi and General Tso.",2,"good"
