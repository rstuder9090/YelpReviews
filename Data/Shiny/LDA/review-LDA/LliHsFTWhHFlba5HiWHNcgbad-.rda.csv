"2","The seating is falling apart on the surface and could really use replacing, but the quality of food will keep us coming back. We used to go to the Sushi Ai on Dorsett in MO, but their quality started heavily declining and wasn't super to begin with, so we stopped going there. We were in the area of this location recently and feeling sushi, so we stopped in and were wowed with the quality so much that we came back some weeks later (a 30+ minute drive) with the same result. 

The service was fantastic the first time (literally one other customer that time--probably 2PM on a Saturday) and above average the second time (busier--weeknight evening)--we did have to ask again for an item and there was confusion over who's plate was whose when he brought a plate and said the incorrect name of the sushi, resulting in the person asking for hot sauce, because it was supposed to be made spicy only to realize the plates at been mixed up after the hot sauce was added. Due to the mistake and now having two spicy rolls and no not-spicy roll, they made more not-spicy sushi fresh and allowed the person who likes hot sauce to take that ""ruined"" sushi home without being charged for it. 

We love the food; lots to choose from, though the entire sushi menu is not on the AYCE menu. But unlike the Dorsett location, this one has a couple types of chicken entrees (in smaller but still decent size quantities) on the AYCE menu as well as tempura (fried) oreos--yuuummmm. I am regretting doing this review now, because I want to go back for more now! I'm specifically a fan of the yamasa roll, the eel nigiri, and my husband likes this miso soup more than any other place he's had it. We love the shumai and sweet and sour chicken, as well. The California roll is also good. My husband likes the Philadelphia roll and some others I don't remember. 

There is a different all-you-can-eat price for weekend and weekday as well as lunch for both weekend and weekday; weekday lunch cheapest and weekend dinner most expensive. Definitely not cheap for weekend dinner, but it's AYCE and very good. You do have to pay for what you do not finish, so don't order a ton up front. You can keep placing orders for more.",1,"good"
"3","If you like any of the Sushi Ai's in the St. Louis area, you then will also like their metro-east cousin!  The menu is identical. Simply great AYCE sushi. The price here is a little higher than in St. Louis. I can't explain that, other than cost of product on one side of the river versus the other. But nevertheless, the quality and taste is exactly the same; excellent!

There is one thing about this Sushi Ai that I must admit I don't care for. That is, it's collocated with a Chinese take-out joint. I get it. It lends great cost efficiency to the operation (a single restroom, single soda fountain, single kitchen, etc). But the odors associated with Chinese food (many fried menu items), tend to ""bleed over"" onto the sushi side of the operation. I really don't want to smell fried Chinese food, while I'm consuming delicious sushi!  But the food is so damn good and reasonable, I can overlook this minor inconvenience rather easily.

The price difference between the lunch AYCE is $12.99, versus $19.99 for dinner. At this $7 difference comes a considerable difference in the items offered.  The best sushi and rolls, as well as additional appetizers are only offered as part of the dinner AYCE menu. The good news is, if you really have to have that Volcano Roll (dinner item, and my personal favorite), they will let you order from the dinner menu for lunch, but you'll be charged the dinner price. To me, when in a sushi mood, the price is worth it!

Decor is basic Japanese. Nothing extravagant; looks more like a fast food joint than a sushi bar. It's kinda' small, so bigger crowds can be difficult to accomodate.  The rest rooms are small, but clean. This isn't a date spot. But it's a great place if you really feel like getting your sushi on!

I'll be back, again and again!",2,"good"
"4","Even with having a Groupon at this place, my friend and I believe that this place was not worth it at all. The only reason why I would give it one star is for the decent service that we received. The rice to fish ratio for the nigiri was terrible, probably like a 8:1 ratio of rice to fish based on the photos below. The taste of the eel and salmon nigiri were okay but the tuna and white tuna was terrible and very fishy tasting, which means that it is not fresh at all. The rolls we're mediorce at best and consisted of 50% rice, 40% vegetables, and 10% of actual fish/seafood. The ice cream was very questionable. It was oddly chewy, icy and gummy. In addition, the ayce menu consisted of green tea cream, mango ice cream, and red bean ice cream. When we ordered it, they gave us vanilla ice cream instead of green tea ice cream. We asked the server about the error and he stated that they ran out of green tea ice cream and gave us vanilla without even notifying us of the change. Since there would be an upcharge if we did not eat it, we were forced to eat something that we did not even want to begin with. We will certainly not be coming here anytime soon until they fix up this place and create standards for their sushi.",1,"bad"
"5","So what do u know about fish to rice ratio? Take a look at how Sushi Ai does it to optimize profit.

The place looks poorly maintained. Chairs and booths are damaged and look like they were bought from a fourth hand store. They look worn down, discolored, and material peeling off. I was uncomfortable just sitting there.

Service was alright. Brought the food as ordered. Plus: filled water as needed. My friend and I were only interested in the normal AYCE option but the premium had the ice cream, so we asked if we could get ice cream in addition to the dinner for an added price. The server said it was no problem, which was really nice. Con: the ice cream was freezer burned. Options included green tea, which we ordered, but were given vanilla instead. When we asked the server, they said they did not have green tea so they gave us vanilla instead (without letting us know or asking if we still wanted it). Major con: the vanilla ice cream was so artificial I thought I was eating cold gum/taffy.

Ok, so appearances and service aside, how was the food? Awful. Don't go here. There's an understood/implied decrease in quality for higher quantity at AYCE places. I was still blown away by how low quality this place was, despite having these expectations. It's an AYCE sushi place so we started with and planned to stick with the sushi. Well, it was so bad that we had to move to appetizers to get eat towards the value we paid for. So here's the run down:

Sushi? U mean rice with a side of thinly cut fish, similar in size to when Mickey cut the bread in 'Mickey and the bean stalk'. Don't worry I'll attach a pic for reference.

I lost all interest in taking pics of the food after the sushi but we got appetizers after so we could eat something outside of rice. Crab Rangoon was sweet, like a dessert (without any sweet and sour sauce, seriously?). Did they accidentally add imitation crab meat to cheesecake batter and thought it was a good idea to go with it??? Gyoza - decent and edible. Onion rings and vegetable tempura were flavorless but fried well. Drench them in the given sauces and there was flavor. Sweet and sour chicken was drenched in sauce and just flat out tasted sour. I was able to eat my half of the other stuff but I really couldn't manage this one. We also ordered Oreo tempura but I couldn't eat it bc I was so sick of all the sweet or sour things by that point. And I love Oreos. Apparently it was the best thing there though bc they only fried it and didn't tamper with it any further.

I would prefer to put more effort into reviews so they would be higher in quality and more informative, but this place was so bad I just want to get rid of these memories at this point. This place gets 1/5 stars bc 1. the service, at least, deserves some acknowledgement and 2. I can't go lower than 1 star.",2,"bad"
