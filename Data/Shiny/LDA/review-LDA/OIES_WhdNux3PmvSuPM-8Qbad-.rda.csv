"2","This is some of THE best sushi I've had in Tampa, the prices are very reasonable, and it's right in our neck of the woods!  Fish and seafood are the stars here and it is all super fresh.  We started with the shrimp tempura appetizer.  It include two fresh, sweet shrimp in wonderfully light batter and some fresh veggies.  Tempura can easily be greasy or too heavy but this was absolute perfection!

For our sushi selection, we tried to stick with some simpler rolls, as these are usually a very good measure of the chef's skill and the freshness of the fish.  The Bagel roll is one of our standard orders - smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallion.  The smoked salmon pieces were huge and the salmon itself was outstanding.  We also sampled the Florida roll - tuna, cucumber, scallion, mayo with citrus tobiko on the outside of the roll.  The tuna was also a huge portion and very fresh.  The veg inclusions were a nice balance to the richness of the fish, but we couldn't taste/didn't notice the citrus tobiko at all.  Rounding out the simpler rolls, we did the Key West roll - spicy conch, avocado, roe, scallion and cucumber.  This was our least favorite - mostly because we suddenly remembered why we prefer conch in fritter form only.  The conch was good, though not at all spicy, but like all conch - there were very chewy spots.  Eh, not quite our thing but worth a shot.

The only ""premium roll"" we got was the Snow White - house made slightly spicy crab salad (yes, crab with a 'C'), avacado and tempura tips on top.  The crab salad was so outstanding, we ended up scraping the tempura crunchies off the top of most of the rolls as the bread taste only distracted from the sweet, just-enough-spicy crab.  This was outstanding and we are thinking of asking for a custom roll of just the 'crab special' and cucumber on our next visit.

Great, quiet atmosphere, good service and an easy to find location.  Toki made our tummies very happy and we spent the whole drive home plotting when we can next return.  My absolute #1 pick for sushi in Tampa!",1,"good"
"3","My Yelp friends Christy T., and her fianc√©, David H. (from Orlando) joined me for a superlative-laden sushi banquet at Toki Sushi on N. Dale Mabry in Carrollwood this past weekend.

The three of us are sushi fanatics -- we like our sushi pure, and not rolled up with a bunch of gunk inside and dripping with sickly sweet sauces. As a result we had been plotting an evening at a local sushi house to test the skills of the resident sushi master. I have been a loyal client of Toki Sushi for over ten years, and have become good friends with head chef, Chris, who was classically trained in Japan, and who brought his skills to the US about 40 years ago. With Chris's help we planned an evening of Omakase delights for the three of us to enjoy.

At the appointed time, I arrived and said ""Konichiwa, Itamae"" to Chris, which is the formal way of greeting the sushi master, and showing respect for his craft. The concept of Omakase is basically saying ""Chef's choice"", or more correctly ""We are putting our trust in you to deliver the best possible meal for us"". Since Chris and I had arranged for the Omakase meal in advance, he was able to order some special treats and to arrange very elegant preparations for us to enjoy.

The Omakase meal is served as a series of small plates where the tastes, textures, and sensual delights flow smoothly from one dish to the next. Chris asked if there was anything that we didn't like, and then set about placing the courses in front of us one at a time. I've included photos for each course, but here are the descriptions:

#1 - Octopus and Shrimp miso salad

#2 - Tuna Tataki

#3 - Squid with yuzu tobiko and Squid with uni

#4 - Chutoro - Medium-fatty Tuna

#5 - Marinated Sea Bass

#6 - Seared Salmon Belly

#8 - Mackarel Roll

#9 - Uni and Firecracker (mixed with Octopus)

#10 - Giant Clam

#11 - Squid with wasabi tobiko and Albacore Tuna

#12 - Sushi handroll with Eel and sliced Avocado

12 courses of incredible deliciousness that we're still talking about. This was not an inexpensive meal - roughly $75 a piece, but if you truly love sushi then you owe it to yourself to try an Omakase meal sometime at the hands of a sushi master.

Chris entertained us with stories of his training in Japan, and we discussed techniques for cleaning and preparing the fish, as well as his amazing knife skills as he shaved wafer-thin slices of fish and rested them atop his carefully-crafted rice.

This was a spectacular evening with two great Yelp friends, and the wizardry of our chef.   Domo arigato, Itamae!",2,"good"
"4","Went here on a Saturday night, there were only 2 tables occupied. Yelpers know this is a red flag but we tried it anyway. The husband got the sushi which was very expensive and not very good. I was in the mood for steak teriyaki and the only option was a bento box called the Dinner Box but it was $29.95. Wow, that is super pricey, I can get a ribeye steak at a super nice restaurant for that price. I decided to take the gamble and ordered it. Now let me tell you why I will never come here again. My $30 dinner box came with 4pcs of tempura (was good), a small salad (iceberg lettuce yellow, not green), a pinch of seaweed, a piece of broccoli, some sort of small fried potato pancake, and a small amount of shaved or thinly sliced overcooked beef. The meat looked like the kind they put in a philly cheesesteak sandwich. I was in so in shock and speechless, I didn't have the energy to complain which is what I should have done. For $30, they can't even give me a steak filet??!! This was my first and last visit to Toki.",1,"bad"
"5","I don't know what's inspiring some people to such Toki-enthusiasm, but it's a genuine 5 or 6 on a 10-point. Comparing Toki to the majority of Tampa sushi which I've been to, it just didn't stand out. 

The inside is pretty plain, stainproof carpet and teal composite table with unforgiving chairs. The sushi rolls are your standard combinations with good ingredients. No Instagram-worthy displays, but that's forgivable because it tastes pretty good. The sashimi is actually a weak point here. Tried everything but the omelet and the krabstick on one visit or another. Most of it was fresh and the portions were reasonable, but I've had the same items at other places that've trumped in terms of freshness, technique, and display. 

The sea urchin was a real disappointment. I order it at every place, and Toki's has been the worst sea urchin of any place that didn't come back and apologetically say they were out. The octopus and squid were also brutally tough, maybe because they had been frozen prior or maybe because the chef did nothing to tenderize it. When I order dishes a la carte, they're equally unimpressive. It's definitely worth something that I'll eat ANYTHING on the menu because none of it is offensive, but it all just feels perfunctory.


The only reason I feel bad writing this review is because the staff has never been anything but courteous and friendly, making conversation and no goofed orders in maybe 8 visits. People who think they like this place should try Tomo on Bearss and Florida - Same charm, but +1.",2,"bad"
