"2","We tried Sushi Bar last night when our usual place had a (temporary, I hope) problem with an unappetizing odor. So glad we made that decision--this place was excellent.

Saturday night around 8 PM and we got a table no problem, although the restaurant was busy. Got a great two-top in front of the window that was perfect for conversation with The Huz.

Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful. I asked her for her top three favorites and she asked a few follow-up questions (raw or cooked? cold or hot? fried or baked?, spicy or not?), then gave us suggestions for a variety of choices.

We decided to skip the special roll with the jalapeño on it (I can't remember the name, might be Jalapeño Roll) because she said it was very spicy and that's not my thing, then Huz said I could make all the choices because he always likes what I pick. I like to spread our choices out between hot & cold plus a variety of fishes:
-- Spicy Girl ($10.99) has ""sword fish, white fish, crab meat, pineapple with green spicy sauce on top"". The sauce didn't look green but it did have a kick and a little sourness to it as well. The bits of pineapple were a nice surprise in the bite & not overdone. The waitress recommended this one for someone who likes the level of heat to not exceed that of spicy mayo (e.g., me).
-- Tokyo Roll ($10.99) has ""spicy salmon, baked salmon with spicy mayo on top"". The roll was topped with crunchy bits, too. It was a creamy, salmon-y taste that was very good. May have been Huz's favorite, which makes me smile because it was the only one I chose that the waitress didn't specifically recommend.
-- Dynamite ($9.99) has ""spicy shrimp, eel, avocado, crab meat, salmon"" and is deep fried. There was spicy mayo and (I think) eel sauce on top, too. It is a wide roll but the slices are thin enough that one bite will do it. I loved all the different flavors in this one and saved this for my last bite because it was my favorite.
-- Statue of Liberty ($15.99) has ""crab meat, avocado, mango, baked lobster, scallop with spicy mayo on top"". This one was baked & piled high with stuff, although the slices themselves weren't very big. I didn't taste the mango. It was good but not our favorite and, as the most expensive roll, had the ""lowest flavor to price ratio"" according to Huz.

The waitress told us that the baked roll would take longer so when we ordered we asked for the rolls ready earlier to come out first, which the lady who took our paper said was a good idea. We got some edamame to eat while we waited and all of our rolls came out together 15-20 minutes after we were done with the edamame. I didn't mind at all because we were having such an enjoyable time together. As a matter of fact, I thought it was great since the restaurant was so busy and we've had horrible experiences with waiting too long for sushi at Tegry Bistro. I liked having all of the rolls at once because I like to compare the flavors.

Huz drank two Kirins on special for $2 apiece, although I see in other reviews that the special price might be the regular price. That sits just fine with him.

We would go back to Sushi Bar in a heartbeat. Everything was delicious and service was outstanding. Oh, and I loved saving $5 using Coupons4Indy.com.",1,"good"
"3","This place is absolutely, positively incredible.

For starters, the sushi is as good as you'll find for three times the price at a trend-setting Chicago or downtown Indy sushi restaurant, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, and intimate. (When Mrs. Quest and I had dinner there a few weekends ago, I ""overheard"" every single catty remark the verbose young gentleman at the table next to ours made about all three of his closest friends. That was a bit of dinner entertainment.)

Then there's the bottled beer menu. Basically, it works like this: all domestic bottles are $1.00. That's right, $1.00. 

But what if the thought of drinking a Miller Lite with dinner gives you hives? What if you just can't eat sushi without sipping one of those giant silver cans of Sapporo? They've got you covered. (But it'll set you back $2.00 instead of just $1.00.)

Awesome place to eat your fill of delicious rolls or just sit around and get tanked on suspiciously--probably illegally-cheap--beer.",2,"good"
