"2","I stopped in here on a Sunday, during a Saints game, so naturally the place was empty but the game was on! On Sundays, they give their sushi chef the day off, but they were serving poke which was exactly what I was in the mood for.

I got the Rainbow Bowl that came packed with Ahi, Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Snowcrab cucumbers and avocado topped with Lava and Waikiki sauces, sesame seeds and green onion. The food came out quick and it was fantastic! The fish was fresh and the bowl was huge. I especially liked that it had just enough rice, but not too much, like other poke bowls. 

The owner was friendly throughout the meal and the atmosphere is cool and laid back. As a consumer, if I had one suggestion it would be this- the menu is really big; there's breakfast, sandwiches, poke, sushi, salads, a ton of sides and spam. I would pare it down a bit and maybe stick to sushi, poke and spam- I don't think you need to offer a ton of sandwiches, salads and sides. I would say offer maybe one or two signature sandwiches, one or two salads and let the rest be sushi, poke and spam (to stick with the Aloha theme). Those are just my two cents, but I really did enjoy my experience here.",1,"good"
"3","There are two words that will get me out of bed no matter the time, place, or level of particular discomfort I may have from a previous night out in New Orleans. Two words in my foodie lexicon that bring excitement and get my mouth watering every time. Those two words? BREAKFAST BURRITO. When I heard a new Hawaiian joint opened up in the old El Libre spot on Calhoun that had a breakfast burrito with an island sway, it climbed straight to the top of my ""gotta check out"" list. Aloha Lei started as a stall in the Auction house market, but they have expanded to their own little spot offering up foods with the flavors of the Pacific Rim, with a local bend. Poke' bowls featuring spicy crawfish, Fried Chicken &  Waffles, Musubi, and a creative sushi menu with a touch of southern flair. I had my sights set on the Smoked Kalua Pork Breakfast Burrito. This bad boy is stuffed with fried eggs, crispy tater tots, a pineapple pico, and juicy shredded pork. With the addition of a little sriracha, this burrito was sweet, savory and spicy. And I love how it is wrapped up then griddled again to meld all the flavors and give the tortilla a nice crunch. It's an interesting and adventurous take on a breakfast burrito for sure. For the less adventurous, they offer a Katsu fried chicken Sandwich, and a Burger ""Americana"" with bacon pinapple jam. The cocktail menu, as you would imagine, has numerous tiki type concoctions to make you feel like you are on a sandy beach instead of a dead end road just off Claiborne Ave. Overall, there are plenty of reasons on this menu to return for seconds, or thirds, or more...",2,"good"
