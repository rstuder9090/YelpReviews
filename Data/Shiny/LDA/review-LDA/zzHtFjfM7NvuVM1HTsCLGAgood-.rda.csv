"2","To start as always with Laura's nut allergy. 

They do not serve ANY nuts here! You are safe if that is your concern! 

Also, they warned of their use of sesame without me even asking just to be sure that we were safe since sesame can be a common allergy as well. That showed a deep understanding of common allergens. 

Now to the service and food. 

The waiter was extremely kind and very attentive. He filled our drinks often and checked in, joked with us, and gave us time to just enjoy our meal as well. 10/10 

To start we had Sansho Salmon Poké Buns. Absolutely phenomenal and would be the star of the meal if it was even slightly possible to pick star in a meal this good. The buns were delicious cuts of salmon covered in a spicy roe sauce, garnished with carrot and thin cucumber for a sweet and refreshing bite. The combination brought balance to the buttery smooth salmon all nestled in that heavenly cloud. I'm drooling as I write this. 

The ""Sake"" roll was exactly as it should be. The rice was made very well. Rice can make or break any sushi and theirs was on point. The avocado was ripe and the salmon was just as buttery and smooth as the salmon on the Sansho Salmon Poké Buns. Simple, delicious, just right. 

Onto the Ramen. I personally had the Shoyu Yasai Vegetarian Ramen (egg add on) and Laura had the Karai Yasai Vegetarian Ramen but we shared of course. Easily my best ramen bowls I've had to date. The broths had so much flavor. They were jam packed with mushrooms, noodles, an egg, bok choy, tomato, onion, sprouts, OH MY! They both bursted with flavor! Umami, Umami, Umami! The bok Choy in both bowls still retained their crunch, and the mushrooms all still had that satisfying, hearty, and earth laden flavor. The eggs were cook perfectly and had that salty egg white we all crave from a ramen bowl. The onions and sprouts added a nice zip to the noodles with each bite! The broths really are your preference they were both wonderful. 

Amazing restaurant! If you are in or outside of the area EAT HERE!",1,"good"
"3","First of all, I wanted to thank them for the amazing service and making us feel welcome. We have a toddler who usually won't sit still and eat well at the restaurants. We usually dont go out often because of this reason, but I was craving ramen so much to just to stay home. We've heard of the place opened up recently and wanted to try. We went as soon as they opened at 11:30 for lunch so it wasn't too busy. Again, very welcoming. We ordered a pork bun which was very delicious. They knew we were sharing and removed all hot sauces and spices of one bun for the little one (so thoughtful!) Same with Ramen too, they gave us an advice on which soup is milder for a toddler to enjoy. Everybody in the restaurant was so nice to my child I think she enjoyed all the attention haha. It was the first time I could actually enjoyed my meal without having to worry about her and she enjoyed her meal too. I didnt have to borrow the power of my phone at all today. :) thank you for the lovely meal, thoughtfulness and professionalism. We will definitely return!",2,"good"
