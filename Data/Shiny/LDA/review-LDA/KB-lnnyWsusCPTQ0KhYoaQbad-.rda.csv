"2","I have scoured Indiana in search for a restaurant with extremely fresh sushi and sashimi and Sakura is a pretty great place to go for that! Here's the review:

Atmosphere and service: 

This restaurant is fairly loud, crowded, and cramped. However, we were seated 10 minutes before our reservation time. Yes, I advise you make a reservation if you would like to eat around the time you arrive. Our waitress was very polite and was understandably hurried, due to the packed restaurant. We were seated and immediately given water. Food arrived approximately 15-20 minutes after ordering. The longest wait we had was waiting for our tab. We could not flag down our waitress and ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for our tab. It was slightly frustrating, but I was too contently full to complain. 

Food: 

For appetizers, we got broiled clams, which was served hot on a bed of salt. It tasted very fresh, and was seasoned lightly with salt and a wedge of lemon. (Rating: 4.25/5)

Entrees:

Rock'n'roll roll: lightly tempura'd roll with unagi, tobikko, and veggies. Best out of the 3 special rolls we had. (Rating: 4.5/5)

Hoosier: Spicy tuna and avocado. I was disappointed by the lack of spiciness. However, the tuna tasted fresh. However, my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it. (Rating: 3.25/5)

Soft-shelled crab: I was slightly disappointed by this roll. The crab was cooked properly, but it was topped by a mayo mixture that did not add to the roll. The flavor of the mayo mixture also did not impress me. The inside of the roll was soft and flavorful. (Rating: 3.75/5)

California roll: Average roll, done well but nothing special. (Rating: 3.5/5)

Shrimp tempura roll: Did not come out hot! However, the tempura was well seasoned. (Rating: 3.75/5)

Hamachi: VERY fresh with a nice sheen. Soft texture and yummy flavor. (Rating: 5/5)

Salmon: Delicious! Also very fresh with good marbling and sheen. (Rating: 5/5)

Tuna: I was very disappointed with this. It was not fresh at all. The texture was mushy and the flavor had a slight hint of sourness. (Rating: 1/5)

Yellowtail: I enjoyed this nigiri. Pretty fresh with good texture. (Rating: 4.75/5)

Krab: Fake crab?? Ew. (1/5)

Unagi: Melt-in-your-mouth!! So flavorful and tender. It's a must have! (Rating: 5/5)

Ika: Squid was not fresh. And ika that is not fresh is not good. (1/5)

*Note: All the nigiri has wasabi on top of the rice, as traditional nigiri does. If you don't like wasabi, request a dish without it. I wish our server had told us that before I took my first bite. I love sushi but hate wasabi!!*


Overall commentary:

It looks like a lot, but it was actually mostly from our 16-piece nigiri meal that we shared. It's a bit pricey, but I think that it's fairly reasonable for the quality and freshness of their seafood.",1,"good"
"3","Went to Sakura for the first time last night. When setting up plans for dinner with a friend who lives on that side of town & was open to trying sushi, I saw Sakura on http://www.coupons4indy.com and made the suggestion. Good choice--we had a delicious experience (and saved $5). Service was fine; she was friendly, kept our glasses filled, and checked on us a few times, but had to be flagged when we were ready for the check.

I made a reservation for 3 people on a Wednesday at 6:30 PM to be on the safe side but it wasn't necessary. While the restaurant was plenty busy, there were several tables open and no wait. The dining room is not big but it's not tiny either, and the decor is tasteful. We waited (I'm guessing) 10 minutes for our rolls to come out after we finished our appetizers but I didn't really keep track because we were chatting and, having had starters, not starving.

We started with gyoza ($4.95, fried Japanese dumplings with special sauce) and zaru soba ($7.25, cold buckwheat noodles with a dipping sauce). I saw in other online reviews that people liked them so I gave something other than edamame a try as a sushi appetizer. I liked them both. I don't know if either is made in house, but they were both tasty as prepared with the sauces. The waitress saw that we would be sharing the noodles so she brought 3 bowls of sauce, which I thought was nice.

I thought we might get 5 (or 6) rolls to share but our friend said he was *very hungry* so we ordered 7. It was too much! We tried everything but he ended up taking about a roll's worth home. No big deal--midnight snack!

Rock 'n Roll ($8.40) -- EEL,KRAB,AVOCADO,SMELT ROE (DEEP FRIED 20 SEC, AS TEMPURA)
Sea Eel & Cuke ($5.30) -- COOKED SEA EEL, CUCUMBER
Gabe ($6.30) -- TUNA,FLYING FISH ROE, GREEN ONION, SPICY SAUCE
Soft Shell Crab ($8.40) -- SOFT SHELL CRAB,SPICY SAUCE
Bob's ($5.50) -- ASPARAGUS TEMPURA, SMOKED SALMON, AND SPICY SAUCE
Texas ($6.30) -- SALMON, GREEN ONION, TOBIKO, CHILI OIL, JALAPENO MASAGO, SPICY SAUCE
Mix Florida ($6.10) -- TUNA, SALMON, FLYING FISH ROE, GREEN ONION, TENKASU, SPICY SAUCE

Overall our favorite was the soft shell crab. No surprise there--so many reviewers said it was their favorite. The Huz liked Bob's second best. I may have liked Rock 'n Roll second best but I might have to make another trip to be sure; I did like Bob's a lot too. Not sure what our friend's second favorite was but he did go back for the last piece of sea eel + cuke.

All of the sushi was very good. Fish tasted fresh and flavors were bold. My only complaint was that so many of our rolls had a similar creamy, mayo-based sauce. I chalk that up to choosing poorly, I guess. I try to get a good variety of hot/cold, cooked/raw, and fillings/toppings in our order but (1) the menu isn't super descriptive and (2) I only saw one deep-fried roll on there. Maybe I missed something...? I did tend toward the cheaper rolls so that we could try a bunch while keeping dinner affordable, so maybe the upper end of the menu deserves a closer look next time.

I will also say that many of the rolls were hard to get in one bite...and I'm open to taking distastefully large mouthfuls. I ended up using my fingers and was caught more than once by the waitress mid-bite. Since I had already asked for (and received) a fork, I got comfortable with the idea that I am just an American who does things in bad form.

Unrelated to the meal--I had two coupons with me, one for $4 off $40 and one for $5 off $50. Since our bill was over $60, we used the $5 coupon. I looked around the dining room on the way out to see if there was a table spending over $40. I saw a table with four older people, each with a platter, so I went over and offered them the other coupon. Just as I though, ""This lady is going to think I'm crazy,"" she gave me a high five! That's just the kind of thing that makes a cheapo like me smile.",2,"good"
"4","Unfortunately their Sushi was not for New Yorkers. This place could be Sushi place in Brooklyn or Queens and run by non-Japanese. I checked the Sushi chefs at the counter. I wanted to make sure they were Japanese but I couldn't.......I was sure of the chef on right side was definitely Mexican. I don't want to state that Japanese Sushi chef do better because I had uneatable Sushi experience by Japanese Sushi Chef in Bronxville, NY. It doesn't matter Japanese Sushi chef do better but they should know what good Sushi is.

Especially I was disappointed by Nigirizushi in Sakura. The fish has to be fresh! When our Nigiri plate came, It smelled. Fresh fish should NEVER smell! Wait was very long and even when we got the table, it took very long for food to come around. Poor kid with us, starting to say ""I am hungry!"" ""I am hungry!"". I was very hungry as well when Sushi arrived. It was eatable but wasn't good. I will never serve that to Japanese. I learned not to order if I suspect that Sushi is not care well, then only order rolls. Rolls with cooked stuffs like Tempura with Avocado, cucumber. For fish, marinated fish or spicy ones that killed fishy smell and vinegar or lemons cooks the fish. Most of the restaurant marinate fish is to disguise its freshness. Last result to make fish eatable. Safest Sushi choice would be eel, Tempura and some veggies like cucumber. Rolls are becoming and treated as Burritos in America. Sushi rolls definitely became American. 

Yes, there were some Japanese waiters working there. I spoke with them in Japanese but it doesn't guarantee freshness of fish.",1,"bad"
"5","I was told we were going to a sushi bar.  Japanese all too often implies sushi and little else.  Had I done my homework (naughty boy), I'd have known that Sakura (or Sa-KU-ra in local parlance) was much more the old style Japanese roadhouse.  I'd put money down that the place had been a Sizzler-type in an earlier life.  The place is busy, noisy, and somewhat rustic - no trace of elegance.  But what am I, a snob? I just don't care that Rik Smitts ate there in the 80s.  

Again, the notion that sushi IS Japanese food is dashed by the preponderance of ""kitchen dishes"" like donburi, cutlets, noodle plates, etc.  When sushi hit the US hard in the 70's and 80's, places like this resisted as best they could, losing sukiyaki to California and Boston rolls.  It's a shame.  Still, sushi seems like an afterthought.  The menu barely lists the types of sashimi, nigiri, and norimaki, and I desperately needed reading material during the standing room only 35 minute wait.  I was told a separate sushi menu was available, but only a paper order sheet came whence we were seated.

The apps came quickly and we dug in on veggie tempura and spicy fried squid (which tasted suspiciously Sysco or GFS to me - it's all in the breading).  

Miso soup and and the ubiquitous ginger citrus salad were a buck each, and significantly help the budget diner.  

Here's my break down of the sushi bar fare:

Gabe's Roll - Tasty larger spicy tuna roll HEAPED with additional off-the-bone fish.  

Arizona Roll - Sorta gross, actually.  Again, larger roll heaped with additional fish, but with jalapeno and other poor fusion flavors.

Rock Roll - Larger ($8) roll more like Korean kimbap or futomaki with too much in it, then obnoxiously tempura battered and fried.  Really?  I believe insult to injury was served ala spicy mayonnaise sloshed atop.  

The nigiri items of yellowtail and tuna were decent at two pieces for $2.  Or does my memory fail me...?

Table service was ok.  The matronly Asian servers are all business.  No coquetry or fawning.  

If I go back, I'm not putzing around with the sushi, and will go straight for the heart; the noodle dishes and hot foods.  That kitchen was built for battle, and unfortunately the sushi side wasn't.  

Digression ahead:  If Sakura is one of the oldest Japanese joints in the city, then they are somewhat to blame for bastardizing the cuisine to its sad state of affairs.  Deep fry it and slather in mayo, and Hoosiers will eat it.  Color me cynical.",2,"bad"
