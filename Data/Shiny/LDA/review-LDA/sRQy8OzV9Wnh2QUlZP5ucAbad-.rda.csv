"2","i've been wanting to try this megu since it opened and finally went today with my mom 

it was a pretty good dinner, we ordered a bunch of stuff like tako su, rock shrimp, kara age, eggplant and scallop, tropical summer rolls... then we had the central park roll, lobster roll, and oyster roll... everything was delicious especially the rock shrimp-- definitely very similar to the ny style ones

i was surprised by the ""OYSTER ROLL"", i've never had it until today and it turns out fried oyster is a decent ingredient for sushi too, megu used a splash of mayo with it and cucumber in the sushi... a very good mix-- i actually think i might prefer the oyster roll over the spider roll (with soft shell crab) from now on

tropical summer rolls were one of their recommendation not on the menu, it was alrite, if you like summer rolls, i would definitely recommend that, it's the typical veggies with crab and mayo and apple wrapped together.  i don't like mint leaves so this turned out to be a better pick for me

i really liked the ""TAKO SU"", which is octopus in ponzu (japanese vinegar) sauce on top of seaweed.  very refreshing, great appetizer to start with, and the seaweed gives a great texture almost like a bouncy crunch in your month to loosen your jaw for your meal to come.

""LOBSTER ROLL"" was delicious too, a roll made on a lighter note.. meaning no spiciness, no mayo, no sauce.. it held a very fresh taste, i could definitely taste the lobster apart from the rest of the ingredients

i would pass on the ""CENTRAL PARK ROLL"" which is a spicy toro roll really... i didn't really see a difference between that and a spicy tuna roll other than the price... 

we also got the ""EXOTIC BOMBE"" which is 3 different flavored sorbet ice cream covered in white chocolate in the shape of a ball.  great dessert for the summer.

overall, i was quite pleased with the experience, i would definitely come back esp when they have their sushi special on sun and mon",1,"good"
"3","On a recent trip to NJ I was treated to a meal here by a local friend of the person I was rooming with, and I must say it was a lovely experience! Immediately I appreciated the cool, peaceful atmosphere when we walked in, and that initial positive impression continued throughout the evening. We were given a pretty tan booth to sit in and some spiced cucumbers to much on while we perused the menu. Our server was pleasant and clearly explained the special rolls available that day. Once she'd opened our ros√© (the place is BYOB) we placed our orders. 

I went with this Japanese version of Pad Thai that I was curious to try, since I've already eaten my fair share of sushi and sashimi over the years and nothing on the menu looked super adventurous or different. It was smoky and delicious, but didn't have Thai sauce on it. Instead the sauce was brown, and there appeared to be eggplant and mushrooms mixed in with the noodles. I thought it was wonderful overall! My friends had special rolls, one was eel and the other was a lobster roll. I tried the lobster one and it was tasty, but not really my cup of tea...I prefer straight sashimi honestly. Too much tempura and garnish and the flavors are lost to me. However it seemed really fresh and well-made, so for people who like special rolls this places makes a good one! 

As we finished our meal we were able to relax and chat for the better part of an hour. Our leftovers were quickly boxed up by the staff once we were ready to leave, but nothing ever felt rushed. It ended up being one of the longest dinners I've had in a while, thanks to the overall hospitable atmosphere of Megu. I would go back in a heartbeat!",2,"good"
"4","The sevice was nice but the food was down right depressing. The music was quite loud also... Sat down, got my food and drink ready waiting for my soup and salad. I got my soup and salad but the soup was warm and cold in the middle. Microwaved, blah... salad tasted cold, too cold. Probably refrigerated, (I felt the plate and was colder than the salad? HUH? The presentation was just sad like prison room sad.) I took a bite and felt something different. It was stringy and yup, its a hair. Ok im done those 2. Alright, now to the food. I got chirashi, a basic a simple sushi meal, doubt they cant ruin something basic... right? Nope, guess not. They had bell peppers and pineapple pieces around the bowl and the pineapple juice drooled on the rice. Fish was well average, it didnt have a good taste, just empty. It was like 80% rice, 20% fish. Normally its 50/50 or even 40/60. The rice was tho, it tasted like seasoned rice like store brand seasoning, not traditional rice vinegar and basic seasoning. The price for it was not even good. I got another item which was fried oyster roll. It was good but all i tasted was the sauce overpowering it. Just forgot the soy sause was weak, like half water half soy weak. Overall I give Megu Sushi a 1.5, or in YELP a 1 star. If you want good sushi, go to Asuka Sushi, its better than here give you that.",1,"bad"
"5","Overall the food was good but the service was not. 
They immediately sat us, as there were only five other tables with patrons. Before i could even open my menu to the third page they came over to ask if I was ready to order. They proceeded to come by 3 more times in a five minute span to ask if we were ready to order. It was extremely uncomfortable and unsettling. Once we would finish a plate it was immediately off the table even if the other Person dining was not done. They had two waitresses that were both coming over to ask if we were ready to order and if we were done. They pushed us out of there essentially with their rude and persistent service. 

The sushi and food itself was good but the service was so uncomfortable that I likely wouldn't go back. I can find the same quality of food elsewhere and better with much better service. 

Between the two of us, we had wonton soup, shrimp Shumai, calamari roll, eel roll, California roll and black dragon roll. As I said, all were good. The only few notes I have is the following:

For the black dragon roll- It contains lobster salad, shrimp tempura and eel on top. I added eel sauce to the top as I thoroughly enjoy that. Great combo. But some of my pieces clearly didn't have eel on it and it had avocado on top. I like avocado so it wasn't too much of an issue but that's not what I ordered. 

The calamari roll was weird. The calamari was over cooked and made the roll way too chewy.",2,"bad"
