"2","I've heard good reviews of this restaurant, so I decided to take my mom to lunch and give Daiwa a try.  The decor inside the restaurant is really nice for a westbank sushi restaurant.  Although it was really bright during lunch, I could tell that this place would have a really pretty ambiance during dinner time when the place is darker.  
We were greeted very politely at the door. My mom even commented on how our waitress had a great energy to her and how she seemed to be genuinely sweet.  (I believe her name was Christina).  I thought it was pretty cool how the menus here had loads of pictures, which made ordering extra easy.  
After receiving my Coke in this tiny little bottle, we decided to start our meal off with the Crispy Tofu, Butter and Garlic Scallops, and an order of the Kimchee Udon Noodles.  The Crispy Tofu wasn't very crispy at all.  It was kind of soggy and there was nothing really special about it although it was kinda cool how those thin flakes that is drizzled on top of the tofu seemed to be moving or something.  (Don't ask me why I ordered tofu in a sushi restaurant).  That was my mistake, so I won't really count that one against them.  The scallops on the other hand were perfectly seared and seasoned and was topped off with those stringy mushrooms.  I actually prefer the scallops to be plated over a bed of greens the way Rock N Sake does it, but the stringy mushrooms wasn't bad at all.  

The Kimchee Udon Noodles was the BOMB though!  I plan on coming back to this place just for the Kimchee Udon Noodles.  It is a little pricey though at $9 a bowl and the portion was pretty small.  
I decided to try the Australian Lobster roll and the Cowboy roll.  I was a little disappointed with the Lobster roll because quite a few of my friends suggested that roll.  I thought it was a little weird to roll some lettuce into the roll.  I felt like the lettuce was overpowering and sort of took away from the roll.  Now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't just pick the lettuce out to see how it would taste without it?  *Brainfart*
The Cowboy roll was good but not great.  We only ordered two rolls, so I can't judge the place based on 2 rolls.  It was partly my fault for venturing out and trying different combinations on the sushi rolls.  I definitely plan on trying more rolls the next time I come back for their Kimchee Udon Noodles.  I also plan on coming back at dinner time to experience the moody lighting. =)",1,"good"
"3","Willing to go out of your way for good eats? Of course you do; you're reading Yelp. Head to the West Bank and check out Daiwa! This new Japanese restaurant opened last month and is already gaining popularity by word of mouth.

You might recognize sushi chef and owner Ken Wong from behind the bar at Hana and various Little Tokyo locations, most recently LT Uptown (with me! The funnest and second-clumsiest server they've ever had). Named after the famous Daiwa Sushi restaurant in Tsukiji, Japan, Daiwa serves well-priced sushi rolls, lunch and dinner specials, and a smattering of chef specialties and yakitori.

A group of my former Little Tokyo Uptown co-workers and I headed over this week to support our friend's new venture and both stomachs and wallets appreciated the endeavor. I don't have good pictures of the interiors, but it is brightly lit (which I personally like, as it makes for better photography), with a hand painted cherry branch mural on the wall and Ikea orb lanterns dangling throughout.

The following dishes were split among the 5 of us and filled us all up nicely. Full disclosure: We paid for everything at full-price, no discount, except the complimentary dessert and small-dish sample of glass noodles. Onto the food!

Squid steak: I enjoyed the legs most because I like my calamari charred and crisp. Only complaint, I wish the onions had come cooked or carmelized, as they didn't have enough time on the iron platter .

Baked mussels: Standardly flavored with salmon roe and cream, the chopped pieces of mussels added a nice chew to the sweet sauce.

Agedashi tofu: One of my favorite dishes from Japanese restaurants anywhere, these blocks of tender yet firm tofu are lightly battered and fried, then topped with bonito flakes and chives, served with soy sauce. Nummy nummy!

Cowboy roll: crawfish inside, seared rare steak on the outside - Here is the first of the specialty rolls we tried, the Cowboy Roll. I personally don't like crawfish in my sushi, but I appreciated it's slight spice as contrasted with the delicious, lightly seared beef.

Salmon yogurt roll: Raw salmon, shrimp tempura, salad greens wrapped in Vietnamese rice paper, topped with sweet/tangy yogurt sauce. No rice. - I didn't think I would like this because sweet foods bother me so it was a nice surprise. This was more like goi cuon (Vietnamese spring roll) than a traditional sushi roll. The fresh salad greens with crispy shrimp and supple raw salmon, flavored only slightly with the sweet yogurt sauce, mixed yummily in my mouth. I hate sauce-doused sushi (like so many places in the NOLA do); a light drizzle works perfectly for me.

Sample of a new dish: glass noodles and kimchi. -  While waiting for our next dish, Ken brought out a small sample of a new dish: spicy kimchi glass noodles with chilled cucumber. It reminds me of childhood cold noodle dishes that you buy on the street in Taiwan. Fun note: glass noodles are made with mung beans so they have absolutely no carbohydrates.

Kimchi and hamachi roll  - I didn't try this because I didn't want to. I mean, I like hamachi as sashimi; I'm just not a big fan of like spicy tuna-like preparations. Looked good though, especially if you like kimchi.

 BBQ eel hibachi rice - I was feeling hungry and wanted rice to fill up at this point, so Ken recommended this dish. Probably one of the best hibachi rices I've ever had, with the fatty and meaty eel morsels counterpointing the rice.

Negimaki: Thinly sliced rare beef wrapped around green onion and grilled - Another yakitori dish of grilled beef and green onion. I could probably eat like 3 plates of this.

Salmon salad - Didn't eat the salad, it was pretty much romaine lettuce with raw salmon diced on top. It looked very nice. 

Tofu pudding, topped with strawberry, peach, and blueberry - Last, we enjoyed a dessert of almond tofu jello pudding. A little firmer than flan, slightly saccharine, and topped with fruit and drizzled with chocolate sauce, this was a fitting end. We actually couldn't finish all of them.

Daiwa's location is a little ways out there but I think it's worth making the West Bank Field Trip for. There are so many dishes I want to try. Can I also mention that they have a full bento box lunch special for $8?",2,"good"
"4","Wow. Daiwa was essentially good when they first opened years ago. Today I ate with a big party of people, which was good since we could all try different rolls. As someone who's a fan of ""sushi pizza"" (which normally consists of a crispy croissant-like base, plentiful raw fish, avocados, and seaweed dressed with eel and spicy mayo), the one here was an okay ""pizza"" base... With about three inches of snow crab and small pieces of raw fish. I'm exaggerating about the height, but it was probably about an inch of snow crab. Our waiter told us they were out of avocados. What????? Four more rolls... All of which had CHUNKS of snow crab and tiny pieces of fish. One roll was supposed to have eel in it... But where? Right... It was buried in snow crab. The sushi is cheap quality because of the amount of snow crab vs raw fish (which also tasted fishy), yet it's expensive. A party platter was ordered with assorted fish and sushi... Again snow crab everywhere.... I understand if the menu states what each rolls consists of... But no one expects a lb of snow crab in each of their rolls... Where is the fish at? By all means, if you guys love snow crab, this is your place, or I would recommend purchasing a pack of snow crab meat and mayonnaise to save your buck if you wanna make it at home. Otherwise, try out Umi near DeGaulle. The one star is for the wait staff. They were quick on their feet and nice about everything.

**was not told about avocado until after food arrived**",1,"bad"
"5","I know a lot of people love this place, but my husband and I were far from impressed. 
We eat a lot if sushi. We tried to count at one point and we stopped around 20 restaurants or so.  And when we go to eat sushi, we eat sushi. Not the other menu items, so please note this review is for the rolls, service and atmosphere only. 

Atmosphere: Some if the hardest, most uncomfortable benches I have ever sat on. And if the person in the booth behind you is moving please note that you're going to feel like you're trying to eat on a turbulent airplane. The lighting is bright and harsh. And I like k-pop as much as the next person, but if it is loud to the point I have to shout at my husband across the table, it's too loud. And it's a sushi restaurant, not a bar, there is no need for flat screens everywhere, also with the volume on blast that competes with the music. 

Service: As my husband and I eat sushi about once a week, and this was the first time that we had eaten there, we like to study the menu. Our drink order was taken and the waiter returned almost immediately with the drinks. He asked for our order and we told him to give us five minutes, however instead of attending to other customers, he sat down at an empty table right next to us and stared. After about two minutes he got back up and asked us if we were ready, we told him no. He sat down next to us again. There were multiple empty tables, there was no need to stare us down, there wasn't a line of people. There was no need to rush us. We placed our order and the food was brought out. Then we were summarily dismissed. Our drinks were not even refilled once. We tried to flag waiters down and were ignored. The only time he came by again was to drop off the bill. In short, rude, inattentive and impatient. 

The food: lackluster at best. They put ""spring mix"" (aka soggy colorful nasty tasting lettuce) that watered down the flavor of everything. We started picking it out of the rolls so we could taste something besides lettuce. We literally filled up an entire salad plate with the stuff. The presentation was sloppy. Sushi should be beautiful to the eyes and palate. The rolls were not rolled tightly (they fell apart easily, which is a pain), overpowered with lettuce sticking out everywhere, cut unevenly, unrolling on the plate, and just piled on the plate with no presentation whatsoever. I love tuna, it should be beefy red, slightly chewy and have no odor at all and cut into big chunks. Once I removed all of the lettuce I was left with what looked like discarded pieces, pale pink, mushy in the mouth, smelling strongly of fish. I was afraid of getting ill (I even eat my steaks cold rare) so I didn't finish it. The miso was terribly bland with hardly any tofu or seaweed. Just broth and a ton of green onions. I adore miso and I was sorely disappointed. The only thing I really enjoyed was the iced green tea, but I drank it quickly trying to get the taste of the terrible food out of my mouth and was left wanting a refill that never came. Even the roe was strong smelling and mushy. I like my caviar to have a crunch. 

Long story short, even if this was an isolated incident, it was bad enough that we will not be returning. Thanks but no thanks.",2,"bad"
