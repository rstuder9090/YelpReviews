"2","My husband and I are sushi junkies. We absolutely love it and could eat it multiple times a week without batting an eye. Where we live, we get some pretty good sushi, but it's nothing like the sushi we had when we ate at IRB Sushi. Holy smokes it was delicious! Often here in Cincinnati, we often treat ourselves to sushi when the few places around here offer half-priced sushi deals on certain nights of the week. For the price and quantity we had here, it blows every single place we go to locally, right out of the water. The fish was delicious and fresh, the rolls were beautifully crafted, it was truly an enjoyable meal and we both enjoyed every single bite we had. For the two of us to have 5 rolls, and two house salads, the damage was a mere $53. We looked at the bill and our jaws just dropped. That's such an inexpensive tab for the meal that we had. The server we had was great, she was attentive, and kept our drinks filled, despite being completely busy. My only concern was the amount of open space in the actual restaurant felt a little... empty. Like they could have fit at least 3 or 4 more 4-top tables in. That would have eliminated the need to wait for 30 minutes like we had to when we first arrived. 

This was our first trip to IRB, but I know when we come back, we're going to be going to IRB Sushi again!",1,"good"
"3","Update 7 months later. 
I've been coming out 1-2x a month the past 7 mos, and most of my concerns below have been resolved. The chefs are now the same chefs every time, and their cuts prove that they are honing their craft. And they are friendly. I have not had warm rice or a warm plate any more. The servers are more knowledgeable, and settling in and more friendly.  (ask for Cheryl) 
The manager is around every time I am there, interacting with the tables, genuinely taking pride in the establishment. 
Most importantly, the fish is still very very fresh, without exception every time I am here, the fish itself is high quality.  I have tried a handful of other similarly priced/styled sushi places locally, and they just aren't getting the quality of fish that IRB Sushi is getting.  
You can opt out of cream cheese in a roll, no problem, just ask.
When you ask for light sauce, I do think they are some of the best rolls I have had.

Sushi happy hour is quite a bargain if you can make it between 4-6p tues-thur.

They still have these mystery secret rolls available not on the menu, you have to ask or read the signs in the place. Tom Tom and Tsunami are good.",2,"good"
"4","As a sushi lover I can not recommend this establishment.  The fish was freshish I'll say.  Everything was ok that I ordered .. Tom Tom roll was recommended so I tried it.. Blah .. Sushi I had yellowtail which is normally my favorite and if your a fan you know that it can have a pinkish tint to it when it's really good- this was pure white and almost a cream color- the flavor was still ok but it was not fresh.  I also had the smoked salmon which was fine and the tuna which normally melts in your mouth - no melting here. 
Great location but the sushi is no where near as good as sushi spot or others in the area.  I live near by so it's disappointing that this place can not put out a good product as I would be a regular due to the location.  This was my second try here thinking my first visit here may have been an off night, however tonight just confirmed that they do no have good sushi here.  Sad to report",1,"bad"
"5","I've frequented this place quite a few times. Generally I only eat here because of the happy hour prices and how cheap it is. Pretty much every time they screw something up. They served me half frozen crab Rangoon THREE(3) times in a row until I told them not to bother anymore. Another time my fianc√© and I went with a group and never even got our food! This time we called an hour in advance to place takeout. Simple, right? Obviously not. I ordered Mexicans rolls and was surprised that my bill was higher than normal. They recently increased their prices and never changed the online menu; when I brought this up they were rude and unhelpful. They said they had to ""call the big boss"" to make sure they could give it to me at the price LISTED ON THEIR MENU. What the hell??? Took them 15 minutes to do that and my food was cold, a couple pieces of shrimp were partially frozen in the middle. Never again.",2,"bad"
