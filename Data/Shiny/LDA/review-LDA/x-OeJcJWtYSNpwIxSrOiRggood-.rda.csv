"2","The Sushi is not made by trained Sushi Chefs as Margaret  Kuo's but it is better than nothing, Whole Foods has better sushi. i come here for the Salt and Pepper Shrimp. 
Nothing is outrageously bad. The Pizza offering is a great opened face grilled cheese, the meat loaf gives any greasy spoon a run for their money.
Its cheap oriental buffet food with Hibachi Offerings that depending on the day of the week you makes a great way to stretch out your time here.
We try to make more trips to Pearl or Sampan than here; but when hungry and on the Pike we come back.

Would hate to see this spot become a strip mall-hair and nail salon; will continue to eat here but not as as an end of the world if not.

 The 15th of October, 2016, the Cashier/Manger came over to talk with us and addressed the ""Elephant"" in the room, me.
The help who had noticed the drastic change in my health/appearance, tried to hide their reactions and not hurt my feelings. He asked if i was alright? 
Our conversation lasted a good amount of time.

We, now, have the Dynasty Buffet as our Friends, too!",1,"good"
"3","When it comes to buffets believe it or not this is our go to place for myself and my husband for several reasons.  First, they are very reasonably priced so you can stop in for a quick bite and still not feel like you overpaid because it's a buffet.  Secondly the wait staff and the manager have always been very friendly and accommodating.  When you have a finished plate they pick it up right away and always ask if you need a refill on your beverage.  The atmosphere is quieter and not as hectic as some of those gigantic buffets and sometimes that's just what we want.

Now I have to address the issues people have mentioned about food before where when it comes to buffets, it is common knowledge that sometimes you have a dish that is sitting out for a little while.  Let me just say that due to our work schedules we come in pretty late and close to closing time, and we do not expect the food to be perfectly piping hot the moment we walk in.  When we are among the last patrons of the evening, we simply do not expect this.

However, I feel it is important to note that no matter what time we show up, even if we are the last customers in the building, the staff are always asking us if there is a particular food that we want made fresh on the spot, if for example they see us browsing the aisles and some of the trays look mostly empty or not as fresh.  Usually we are ok with it but they regularly remind us that if there is anything that we want more of made fresh to please let them know.  

In our experience, Dynasty Hibachi Grill and Buffet has always been a very welcoming place for us to go eat, and the staff are always going above and beyond expectations to make sure we are getting the best possible service.  To us, their efforts do not go unnoticed, and for this we will always be returning here.",2,"good"
