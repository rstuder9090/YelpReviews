"2","I have been going to Yama since the year they opened. The sushi is fresh and tastes unique compared to your run-of-the mill sushi places. The roll pieces are bigger than most sushi places also so you get fuller off of less rolls. So I think the $ to $$ range is appropriate. The $ range of other sushi restaurants is usually small rolls that have a ""buffet"" sushi quality. The staff is always friendly and I have never had a bad service experience. Over the years they have developed many fusion type rolls and are always willing to grow. They have been ranked ""Best of Burlington County"" for the past few years for a reason. The only thing I wish they would do/could do is renovate the old diner car it used to be. If I won the lottery I would definitely give them money to do that because I hope this place stays around for years to come. I drive 25 minutes one way to get there for a reason, and I have 18 other sushi places closer to me. Some people may look from the outside and think ""who goes there?"" and the answer is a lot of people!!! It is very clean and they operate to high standards. The lunch buffet during a weekday is a great way to be introduced to the restaurant. The other menu items are true authentic Japanese Cuisine that is very hard to find in the United States. Sorry Chinese food people but you won't find a ""happy family"" or ""kung pow chicken"" selection on the menu, but a bento dinner box option is a great sampler of the food. Bottom line is- ""give em a shot"" and if you like them, please give a glowing review.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I love this place. We go there whenever we what great service and delicious sushi. The chef there is pretty great and will make pretty much anything you want to order. We always get the Godzilla roll. I don't think we've ever ordered anything other than sushi. It is always so fresh and Yum. The only bit of advice I have for this place is that I wish that the ambience was a little better at night for romantic dinner. It is definitely our go to place if you want good food and BYOB but I just wish it had a little more of a vibe at night. Sometimes it feels like you're in a shopping market. If you're thinking about the chefs special roles just splurge get the more expensive ones they're absolutely amazing.",2,"good"
"4","It has been several years since we've eaten here. It's a bit out of the way for us now that we moved, but we made a drive there in May 2016, motivated by the wonderful memories of how fresh the sushi was and how well maintained and charming the inside was. 

WAS. Blech. We WON'T be back! 

The first thing that hits you is the awful smell inside that reminds you of litter boxes and the odor of food that has found its way permanently into the textiles of room. Yuck. We gave this a pass because, frankly the windows don't open to air the place out. 

The next thing we noticed that our table was sticky. Yuck. We figured it was an oversight. 

The owner is the same guy who has always been there. He is very friendly, always wears super expensive shoes and drives a Lexus SUV. Signs of a successful restaurant? No. Don't be fooled. We were the only patrons in there on a late Saturday afternoon for most of the time we were there. This place is circling the drain. 

While we did not get sick from what we ordered, it was definitely not good quality sushi. Among items we ordered, we got a salmon roll. 3 of the 6 pieces had some weird connective tissue that was completely unchewable and we had to spit them out. Yuck and double yuck!  I've had sushi hundreds of times before, and I have never had anything like it, especially in a sushi fish that is so common to handle by the sushi chef. 

The other rolls we ordered were really skimpy on the fish content and loaded up with the non-protein fillers. One roll had avocado which was not green but brown. Yuck again. 

The nail in the coffin for me was the fact that I ordered hot tea, which arrived promptly. The owner came to the table several times where my empty cup sat near the table's edge, waiting for him to take it for a refill or ask if I desired a refill. He never even acknowledged it, even when he came to fill my husband's water glass. I guess the owner is doing so poorly, he can't afford to offer a second cup of tea.  

Summary: It is a dirty, dumpy place now, and the food quality has taken a serious dive from what it once was. You can dress the owner up in fancy clothes and give him an expensive SUV, but his business isn't getting any of the money that his lifestyle is.",1,"bad"
"5","It's really hard for me to give a restaurant a 1 star review, but this place was a total let down.  I had been there before in the past and had a good experience, but this time I was left extremely disappointed.  
When I walked in the restaurant, the whole place is very dimly lit, especially the area of the sushi bar.  The owner was there and he remembered who I was even though I hadn't been there in quite some time which was nice. 
 I was handed the menu and immediately noticed that the prices for sushi were far more than reasonable with pieces starting at a dollar.  I asked the waitress if there were any special fishes today, and she pointed me to the special rolls.  I asked again what about special sushi fish, and she said they didn't have that.  Not saying that a horrible thing but I typically just go for more simple fare. 
I then proceeded to give my order to the sushi chef behind the bar, ordering them by their Japanese names, which he didn't understand.  I ordered 3 different sashimis, tuna, yellowtail and mackerel.  What I got was tuna, salmon and mackerel, which was the items in the sashimi appetizer on the menu.  The owner realized he made a mistake and gave me the salmon gratis, but I couldn't overlook the extremely thick cuts and strange taste to the fish.  Not strange in an off or disgusting way, but I could tell the fish had been frozen, which is kind of sad.  I then ordered some tamago sushi, and next thing I know they are microwave defrosting it behind the sushi bar.  I was immediately met with disappointment when I bit into the tamago only to find that they hadn't defrosted it completely.  I told the server about it and she offered to heat it up more, but I declined, asked for the check, regretfully paid and left.
On the whole, I would say my experience at Yama was a big disappointment and a bit depressing.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone nor will I return there myself.",2,"bad"
