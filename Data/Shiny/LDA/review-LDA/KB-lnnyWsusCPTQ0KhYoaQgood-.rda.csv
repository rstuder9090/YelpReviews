"2","I have scoured Indiana in search for a restaurant with extremely fresh sushi and sashimi and Sakura is a pretty great place to go for that! Here's the review:

Atmosphere and service: 

This restaurant is fairly loud, crowded, and cramped. However, we were seated 10 minutes before our reservation time. Yes, I advise you make a reservation if you would like to eat around the time you arrive. Our waitress was very polite and was understandably hurried, due to the packed restaurant. We were seated and immediately given water. Food arrived approximately 15-20 minutes after ordering. The longest wait we had was waiting for our tab. We could not flag down our waitress and ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for our tab. It was slightly frustrating, but I was too contently full to complain. 

Food: 

For appetizers, we got broiled clams, which was served hot on a bed of salt. It tasted very fresh, and was seasoned lightly with salt and a wedge of lemon. (Rating: 4.25/5)

Entrees:

Rock'n'roll roll: lightly tempura'd roll with unagi, tobikko, and veggies. Best out of the 3 special rolls we had. (Rating: 4.5/5)

Hoosier: Spicy tuna and avocado. I was disappointed by the lack of spiciness. However, the tuna tasted fresh. However, my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it. (Rating: 3.25/5)

Soft-shelled crab: I was slightly disappointed by this roll. The crab was cooked properly, but it was topped by a mayo mixture that did not add to the roll. The flavor of the mayo mixture also did not impress me. The inside of the roll was soft and flavorful. (Rating: 3.75/5)

California roll: Average roll, done well but nothing special. (Rating: 3.5/5)

Shrimp tempura roll: Did not come out hot! However, the tempura was well seasoned. (Rating: 3.75/5)

Hamachi: VERY fresh with a nice sheen. Soft texture and yummy flavor. (Rating: 5/5)

Salmon: Delicious! Also very fresh with good marbling and sheen. (Rating: 5/5)

Tuna: I was very disappointed with this. It was not fresh at all. The texture was mushy and the flavor had a slight hint of sourness. (Rating: 1/5)

Yellowtail: I enjoyed this nigiri. Pretty fresh with good texture. (Rating: 4.75/5)

Krab: Fake crab?? Ew. (1/5)

Unagi: Melt-in-your-mouth!! So flavorful and tender. It's a must have! (Rating: 5/5)

Ika: Squid was not fresh. And ika that is not fresh is not good. (1/5)

*Note: All the nigiri has wasabi on top of the rice, as traditional nigiri does. If you don't like wasabi, request a dish without it. I wish our server had told us that before I took my first bite. I love sushi but hate wasabi!!*


Overall commentary:

It looks like a lot, but it was actually mostly from our 16-piece nigiri meal that we shared. It's a bit pricey, but I think that it's fairly reasonable for the quality and freshness of their seafood.",1,"good"
"3","Went to Sakura for the first time last night. When setting up plans for dinner with a friend who lives on that side of town & was open to trying sushi, I saw Sakura on http://www.coupons4indy.com and made the suggestion. Good choice--we had a delicious experience (and saved $5). Service was fine; she was friendly, kept our glasses filled, and checked on us a few times, but had to be flagged when we were ready for the check.

I made a reservation for 3 people on a Wednesday at 6:30 PM to be on the safe side but it wasn't necessary. While the restaurant was plenty busy, there were several tables open and no wait. The dining room is not big but it's not tiny either, and the decor is tasteful. We waited (I'm guessing) 10 minutes for our rolls to come out after we finished our appetizers but I didn't really keep track because we were chatting and, having had starters, not starving.

We started with gyoza ($4.95, fried Japanese dumplings with special sauce) and zaru soba ($7.25, cold buckwheat noodles with a dipping sauce). I saw in other online reviews that people liked them so I gave something other than edamame a try as a sushi appetizer. I liked them both. I don't know if either is made in house, but they were both tasty as prepared with the sauces. The waitress saw that we would be sharing the noodles so she brought 3 bowls of sauce, which I thought was nice.

I thought we might get 5 (or 6) rolls to share but our friend said he was *very hungry* so we ordered 7. It was too much! We tried everything but he ended up taking about a roll's worth home. No big deal--midnight snack!

Rock 'n Roll ($8.40) -- EEL,KRAB,AVOCADO,SMELT ROE (DEEP FRIED 20 SEC, AS TEMPURA)
Sea Eel & Cuke ($5.30) -- COOKED SEA EEL, CUCUMBER
Gabe ($6.30) -- TUNA,FLYING FISH ROE, GREEN ONION, SPICY SAUCE
Soft Shell Crab ($8.40) -- SOFT SHELL CRAB,SPICY SAUCE
Bob's ($5.50) -- ASPARAGUS TEMPURA, SMOKED SALMON, AND SPICY SAUCE

Mix Florida ($6.10) -- TUNA, SALMON, FLYING FISH ROE, GREEN ONION, TENKASU, SPICY SAUCE

Overall our favorite was the soft shell crab. No surprise there--so many reviewers said it was their favorite. The Huz liked Bob's second best. I may have liked Rock 'n Roll second best but I might have to make another trip to be sure; I did like Bob's a lot too. Not sure what our friend's second favorite was but he did go back for the last piece of sea eel + cuke.

All of the sushi was very good. Fish tasted fresh and flavors were bold. My only complaint was that so many of our rolls had a similar creamy, mayo-based sauce. I chalk that up to choosing poorly, I guess. I try to get a good variety of hot/cold, cooked/raw, and fillings/toppings in our order but (1) the menu isn't super descriptive and (2) I only saw one deep-fried roll on there. Maybe I missed something...? I did tend toward the cheaper rolls so that we could try a bunch while keeping dinner affordable, so maybe the upper end of the menu deserves a closer look next time.

I will also say that many of the rolls were hard to get in one bite...and I'm open to taking distastefully large mouthfuls. I ended up using my fingers and was caught more than once by the waitress mid-bite. Since I had already asked for (and received) a fork, I got comfortable with the idea that I am just an American who does things in bad form.

Unrelated to the meal--I had two coupons with me, one for $4 off $40 and one for $5 off $50. Since our bill was over $60, we used the $5 coupon. I looked around the dining room on the way out to see if there was a table spending over $40. I saw a table with four older people, each with a platter, so I went over and offered them the other coupon. Just as I though, ""This lady is going to think I'm crazy,"" she gave me a high five! That's just the kind of thing that makes a cheapo like me smile.",2,"good"
