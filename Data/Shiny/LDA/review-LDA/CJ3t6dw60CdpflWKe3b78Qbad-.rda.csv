"2","I loved this place and would give it a five (one of my best restaurant outings ever) but there were some glaring pieces that reduce the overall quality of this place; I'll start with those to get them out of the way:
First (and perhaps most important) is that the chef messed up during his routine a couple of times; not in any huge way, but it was too noticeable.
Our waiter lied to us and told us one round of drinks was on him... it wasn't (but that's a long, complicated story... (my family dinners tend to get there))
No coffee or anything for after dinner besides ice cream. Also no egg rolls (I didn't mind but some of the people at my table did... I mean... It doesn't cater to that type of food specifically so... whatever).
Oh.... Speaking of people at my table (I'd probably call my family that... but no I'm not talking about them here), we had to sit with a random couple. It put me off since I didn't know about it but I guess I'll be prepared for it next time if I go again? (Probably not)
So... all of this complaining... how 4 stars?  Japanes malt liquor.
/The end...
.....
....
I'm kidding, I'm still here.  Though each individual portion was a bit small (per course) it felt like I must have eaten 20 courses and I would have been well satisfied if I hadn't been so drunk off of Malt Liquor.... Also, is it ok to like a place because all of its staff is pretty or is that not PC?  Or maybe I should take another look at the staff minus the Malt Liquor.
Bathroom was top tier. 
The bar area was very cool and modern and I kind of found myself wishing I could have spent some more time in there.
Also, even though the waiter got us with the whole ""this round on me"" thing and proceeded to bring us all triple shots (basically) the price was still pretty reasonable.
Oh... all those courses by the way... delicious.  It's rare when I don't just shovel down food and actually savor the experience, and I don't even know what a savor is (some kind of Jedi sword maybe?) when I am as drunk as I was, but it absolutely cut through.
Also, lastly, I busted the chefs balls a bit because he messed a bit, but he really was an excellent showman and the things he didn't mess up on had me absolutely mesmerized... but again, Japanese malt liquor.  
Go there, but go early; it was perfect when we came but was quite literally packed when we were leaving.",1,"good"
"3","My only previous hibachi experience was at an all-inclusive restaurant in Mexico.  While they tried hard, it wasn't the hibachi experience I had always wanted to try.  So the hubster promised me a trip to Benihana - most of the hibachi places in the Lehigh Valley get lackluster reviews, so we figured we'd go to the trademark!

We chose to go for lunch, mostly to save cash.  Lunch hibachi meals range between 10-15 and include fried rice - dinner meals have more ""extras"" but only steamed rice for 18-30.  Bill for two was just shy of $30.

Lunch time on a Saturday at this location was dead - when we arrived, they were cleaning up a hibachi table that had left a few minutes earlier, and there were two people eating on the sushi side.  They might have sat one more table on the sushi side, and two tables on the hibachi side the hour fifteen we were there.  So very quiet.  But the experience was not lacking for it!  Our waitress took our order very quickly and a hibachi chef was at our table within a few minutes.  I'm sure he's not the best guy they have on staff, but he was nice enough and only made one or two fobbles during his cooking ""show.""  It cured my need for the hibachi experience I missed in Mexico.

Food was very good...especially the fried rice (we sprung for chicken fried rice - a $1 upgrade) and the hibachi steak.  I had the hibachi lemon chicken, which wasn't bad, but I enjoyed the steak more.  The waitress kept our water topped off and stopped by to make sure we were doing okay a few times.",2,"good"
"4","DO NOT GO!!! TURN BACK!! FAR BETTER OPTIONS AROUND THE MALL!!
This has to be without a doubt one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant.  Let's start off with walking in, the floors were sticky... like all of the floor was sticky! 
We had a reservation for and got sat at 7:00pm, we finally left the restaurant at 9:45pm. I did not stay there so long out of enjoyment but more out of entrapment. We were sat at our table and were told it would be a little extra time before the server greeted us, ok that's fine, maybe they were short a server.  It did take a long time, and this was a running theme for the whole night.  The server was frequently forgetful, sloppy, and clearly over extended.  Most people at the table got meals that included soup and salad, so those came out (although very far apart), but the chef was nowhere to be seen even well past 8:00pm.  I asked someone at the bar because the host and our server had disappeared.  I was told that they were short a chef. Wonderful.

Finally after asking the host again 15 minutes later we were told our chef was on his way out in a moment.  At 8:15pm he finally did arrive.  This chef was either not very good at what he did as far as teppanyaki or he was under the pressure to complete cooking as fast as possible to move on to the next table quickly.  He largely didn't do any tricks, which is why you pay the exorbitant price for entrees at Benihana. The chef cooked both of our steaks ""well"" when we had each asked for ""medium"" and ""medium-rare"" respectively, but by that point we had been in the restaurant for 2 hours. Among my steak meat was a giant piece of grizzle, something that should have been trimmed off before even cooking or even serving.  The chef overcooked a lot of the food actually, the meat, the vegetables, and even the rice.  On that note, he was making the rice and realized he had no bowls to put them in, so he just kept tossing it until the server eventually got within eyesight so that he could tell him to get some bowls.  He tossed the rice for about 5 more minutes than he should have. 

His 'volcano trick' which he did at the end was with rings of onion he let cook on the griddle the whole time, so they were limp and he had a hard time putting them on top of one another.
I don't say this to nitpick, but to show the level of amateurishness with this establishment and it's staff.
When we had first voiced concerns about having no chef and waiting so long, we were told that the manager would come around to speak to us.  That never happened and I had to seek out the manager myself again.  He came over after the chef left and didn't even offer to make things right, he just kept making excuses as to why the service that night was horrible.
He said he would look at the overall bill and make an adjustment... very vague.
Another half hour seems to pass and by this point I am ready to just walk out.

The manager is up front dealing with another customer's problematic evening (there seemed to be many disgruntled customers this night). I got up and went to the front to square away the bill, and the server miraculously showed up then with a new bill that gave 15% off. I'm sorry, but for wasting nearly 3 hours of my night on a horrible experience is not worth 15% off. This was a birthday night and it was meant to be a celebration and it just turned into an awful evening with recriminations of why I even bothered to come.
The manager again offered excuses, they had a pipe burst earlier in the day, I informed him that the last time I came to this restaurant the air conditioning had failed.  Clearly this location has issues.

I offered for him to comp us for the chicken fried rice and the $10 glass of wine my dining guest had and that would be enough of a gesture to square things away.  He said they could not comp alcohol, which seems to me dubious. He bumped the percent off the bill to 20% begrudgingly, which to me seemed like he was trying to wring as much money out of the night as he could, when instead he should have been trying to satisfy customers so that they might one day consider even coming back.

Of this much I am certain, I will NEVER go back to this location again. I will tell friends and family to avoid it at all costs, and I am posting this feedback to Yelp to further warn away potential customers.
This location in Plymouth Meeting, PA has serious issues... staffing and equipment.  There are far better and more affordable choices nearby and I suspect that this location for Benihana won't be around for much longer.

Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else... ANYWHERE ELSE!",1,"bad"
"5","Omg where do I start???? We was so excited to get an invitation to Our Neice 26 Birthday Party Dinner. At first we didn't know where it was but my niece text me and said at Benihana's and we said great. I was thinking we was going to the one in New Jersey. But unfortunately that location wasn't close to my neice. So we went to the one in Plymouth Meeting. We had a while to wait because because they were short. They was trying to seat everyone but some people didn't have reservations. So that made our wait longer then suppose to. The kids was getting restless and it was getting late. So finally we got our tables and were seated. Some of the staff was acting like bobbleheads all over the place. It took a good 20 minutes before the chef came to the table. They had one waiter waiting on six tables by his self. The waiter finally came to the table to ask us about drinks we didn't really look at the menu because we had to download it on iPhone it took a minute to get the information on some of the family members phones. So everyone finally Place their order it was plates on the table with napkins no silverware it took them a good 20 minutes for silverware so I made a comment. Do they have to wash and roll them we had our food but no silverware I know I'm jumping before but then the manager came out and was trying to help the waiter. The drinks came out late no one had water then finally the chef came out his uniform was dirty with food stains all over it he was cooking our food and the food was flying everywhere he didn't know how to do the volcano he didn't know how to do the pumping heart with the rice he really needed to go back to training and start over again I think they just hired people take a little class and you're on the grill but he was not entertaining at all and the money that we pay for show and dinner was unacceptable. I don't recommend this Benihana's to no one. And then when I was eating my food I had a shrimp shell in my food that was disgusting. So it was shells all over the grill then he  placed the bowl between me and my husband and eggshells shrimp shells and everything that he cooked on the grill was all on the side of our plate. I had to tell him that all the money that were paying the food was everywhere. The money that you pay at Benihana's they should give you a lot of food the portions that you received at this location is like a children's portion I don't recommend this $40 a plate we could have went some where else and got more for money. Especially when you have a chef that absolutely don't know what he's doing but it was upsetting so we start talking amongst our self and he was doing his own thing then he told us that he had to go to another table to cook. I believe that was the last table for the night but he should have went home after he left our table. That wasn't the kicker for the night the kicker for the night was the manager put a gratuity on everyone's bill without anyone knowing it was up to us to pay what we wanted not what was on the paper this was dishonest to the customer. I think they're trying to make up the lost from the pandemic is not fair is unlegal and I want my money back!!!!!! One thing that was great about this event that my niece had a nice time just to share her birthday with some of her family members. And this was her first time here. they hurried up and wrote our bill out and did want to sing Happy Birthday are you kidding me after all we have been through all they had to do is shake the tamarine and sing Happy Birthday. So the waiter and some other waitress came over to sing Happy Birthday. I just talked to some of my family members and they had diarrhea from the food last night this is unacceptable the whole table had diarrhea what is going on the health department needs to come there and shut it down. How can a whole table be sick. And each of us stayed in the bed all day we didn't know that until we called each other to find out what happened. And another thing while me and my sister was talkin we was saying that it was not sanitized because of the pandemic. Between the customers the chairs and table tops was not wash down so we might have not been the only one sick you never know until other people read your message. And you know the craziest thing to is I usually take pictures but unfortunately I did not take not a one picture last night and I'm so mad because if you would have seen how the chef had our table top you would have known what I was talking about. But only thing I can do is voice my opinion and speak out of what my experience at this Benihana's location. In my party it was my mother, husband, sister, nephew, and my self. But we come to this location for dinner and everyone has diarrhea  unbelievable. I'm so pissed at this time. I might all have food poisoning. I never been to a restaurant when the whole party gets sick.",2,"bad"
