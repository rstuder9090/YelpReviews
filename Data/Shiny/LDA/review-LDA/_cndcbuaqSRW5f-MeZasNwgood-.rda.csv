"2","I've had a hankering for hibachi for the longest time now and the other day I randomly found this place and decided to give it a try. Inside is a fairly sized restaurant with some bar seating, a few regular tables, and plenty of hibachi tables. My BF and I opted to sit at a regular table but ordered the hibachi dinners. The hibachi dinners cost around $20 and come with the standard house salad/ginger dressing, miso soup, and also ice cream (although we didn't want our ice cream). I love ginger dressing and theirs does not disappoint. Their ginger dressing is oddly cream colored and pretty liquidy but still tastes absolutely delicious. Their miso soup is basic but tasty. The hibachi dinner came out really quickly since we sat at a regular table, and we asked for yum yum sauce. Food was as expected, nothing mind blowing but will absolutely hit the spot for a hibachi craving. My BF and I both got steak for our proteins, asked for medium rare, and neither of our steaks came out too overdone (though probably more like medium than medium rare). I like a lot of veggies and thought there could've been slightly more veggies, but that's just being nit picky. There was definitely a good portion of the protein and overall serving size is good! If I were in the area again, I wouldn't mind coming back!",1,"good"
"3","We (me + wife) initially started coming here as a friend has his birthday almost every year.  The performance cooking is sure to please anyone who has never seen it, and even those who have seen it a few times like myself.

Our last visit here was on a Tuesday late October celebrating a friend of ours winning 3 Best of Nashville awards, and we came for some reason without a reservation (I believe due to too many ""maybes"" on the invite - don't know why really, I was not the planner).

I did not expect to be seated at a grill, but was pleasantly surprised when we got there that they had more than enough space for us.  They were quite accommodating as chunks of our group could not make it on time and people had to leave before eating (too many things going on).  The waitstaff seemed to be running at exactly the right speed that night.

When the majority of our party was gathered, the chef (Chad) came out, did a show that involved using spatulas to play something that resembled the music that started nearly every 1970's Kung Fu movie.  It was a cacophony of audio embellishment I had not expected or experienced before.

He juggled eggs, made a flaming onion volcano, things went flying everywhere but not a single rice grain made it past the grill toward us.  The performance had the air of a professional who has done it so many times that he could be doing advanced calculus in his head and not skip a beat.

He prepared the vegetarian orders first so as to not slather the tofu in meat juices.  He asked a bit about what defines a vegetarian / vegetarian food prep standards and the veggies there each had different answers with the consensus being prepping the tofu first would probably please most of the veggie world but that the vegans would probably be pissed that it was prepped on a grill post-egg.

My meal was good, not excellent, but near the really good side of good.  My compatriots were all happy with theirs.  I was entertained and it did not break the bank.  The people at the restaurant were nice, attentive.  I find it odd that I have not found something to dislike there in multiple visits.

The place is located 4 feet from where the front door to the old Nipper's Corner theater was if I'm not mistaken.  It's right next to a Jet's pizza, and slightly to the right of Publix if you're looking straight at it.  Parking is easy, the lot is well lit, and the only thing to watch out for is the dedicated Jet's Pizza delivery drivers (who appear to take great pains to not kill anyone)",2,"good"
