"2","Loved it. I was sad to see Eastland Cafe close but Samurai definitely made me less sad. They're on a limited menu for the moment but the options available still beats many sushi menus I've seen. The fish was fresh, the rolls were SO good (they use brown rice which I prefer on rolls), the chef did stops at the tables to check on guests, and the servers were sweet. If I can remember what exactly we ordered, I'll update this . This place is going to get popular fast, so all you Easties get there before the big lines start!",1,"good"
"3","We've been regulars at the original Samurai location on Elliston Place for a number of years (currently renovating) so were were excited to try their new location in East Nashville.  It did not disappoint!  While the menu at Samurai East is somewhat different, the nigiri sushi, sashimi, and rolls are just as fresh and delicious as the midtown location!  They are working on a limited menu (primarily sushi) as they are getting settled into the East Nashville location.  Our server was courteous and efficient.  We've already been twice and are planning another visit this weekend!",2,"good"
