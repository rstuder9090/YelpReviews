"2","Visited on Saturday 10/29/16 at 8PM.   $84 got us two hibachi dinners and two drinks.  This place is not really a ""steak house"" but rather a teppenyaki place that also serves sushi and alcoholic beverages as well as desserts.  

We came at a peak time and had to wait about an hour but they have a nice outdoor waiting area with plenty of seating and the weather was nice so it wasn't so bad.  We signed up with the hostess and she gave us a buzzer to alert us when our table was ready. 

We were seated at a double table that had two griddles and seated 15-17 people.  First came the drinks and then the waiter took everybody's order.  I chose the $30 steak & scallop combination.  The waiter took everyone's menus and in a few minutes brought out soup for everyone. 

The soup was touted as an onion soup...the broth was hot and delicious.  It was full of those shitty fried onions that your grandma puts on green bean casseroles and raw mushrooms which I did not enjoy very much.  I think they'd be better off if they'd just use caramelized onions and cook the mushrooms a bit more.  

Next came the salads which were nothing special and looked identical to the bagged iceberg mix you can buy at any grocery store complete with shaved carrots and purple cabbage.  It was doused in a generous amount of ginger dressing which was good but there was just too much of it.  I had to dig pieces of lettuce out of the bowl of dressing and wipe them on my napkin to eat them. 

Next the chef came out and began his routine.  He was young and cute and very good at what he does.  He had a cheesy but good sense of humor and really wowed us with his skills.  He  knew all the good tricks like the fried rice heart, flipping an egg into his hat, flipping a shrimp into his pocket, and of course the onion volcano. 

Fried rice and noodles are served with every entree and they were very tasty.  I loved my steak and scallops and there was SO MUCH FOOD!  Seriously I spent the whole next day trying to eat all the leftovers. 

Our dining companions all raved about a sauce called ""yum-yum sauce"" which I tried and did not care for much.  It was like somebody added sugar to ranch dressing.  Everyone else at the table was requesting double and triple portions of the stuff and just pouring it all over their food so it's worth a try if you go...you might like it that much too! 

Like any other teppenyaki place, you go for the show and the atmosphere and less for the food but the food was also very good here.  It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion and I enjoyed it enough that I'd definitely go back.",1,"good"
"3","Have been to this location 2 times, once in Dec 2019 and again yesterday. Prior to that we had always went to Ryuu at the Brandon Mall but it closed:-(

Both times I had reservations and my party was seated quickly. Fitst time there was one open seat so there was plenty of room, 2nd time table was completely full and depending on who you are sitting with it can be a tight fit. Like all Japanese Steak Houses you will sit with groups of other parties unless you have a group of around 15 to fill up your own table which is fine and part of the fun.

Server and chef was definitely superb, fun and VERY entertaining first visit last month and pre anticipated things we needed....very attentive without being intrusive. Yesterday service and chef were fine but not fabulous like first visit.


Soup: Your typical clear broth with a small amount of mushroom and green onions but theirs is definitely extra tasty in my opinion...love it.

Salad: Basically your typical Japanese Steak House lettuce, carrot and ginger dressing.....delicious because their Ginger Dressing is extra good.

Land & Sea: Lobster, Shrimp & filet was delicious. Friend and I shared this and we both still got our own soup, salad, rice, noodled, vegetables etc for no extra fee which we loved. Everything perfect. 

Sirloin & Lobster:  Boyfriend got this, Lobster was delicious and perfectly cooked which was fabulous since Japanese Steak Houses have a tendency to overcook seafood. Steak was much tougher than expected and in bigger than bite size pieces and was not given a knife. 

Larger order of shrimp: My entree, was so shocked at the huge amount of shrimp for the price of$29...waitress said 15 but I went for it any way cause boyfriend and I love the leftovers. Delicious meal.

Side of mushrooms: got these on my 2nd visit since the couple of mushrooms I got during my first visit were so delicious and wish I had more; this time they left them in way to large of pieces and did not cook them enough. Will definitely get again but will make sure to ask them to be cut smaller and cooked longer. $5 seems like allot for some mushrooms but it was a large portion, they should offer a small and large portion. 

Hot Sake: Great value at only $6

Kobe Breeze: friend got this first visit, she absolutely loved it, too sweet for me but did have a very tropical taste if you're in the mood for something tropical. 

Will definitely be back to Kobe.",2,"good"
"4","I saw this place emerge from a closed Bennigans to this new restaurant, the food was pretty good, the drinks were watered down, but the service was absolutely awful.

There was a group of 6 of us comprising of 3 couples, they sat us with another group of 5 around the same table so elbow room was at a premium already.  The problem with the seating initially is that the chairs are a little too low from the counter in which you eat from already so try to sit on the bench instead, those seats sit a little higher.

We ordered drinks and upon receiving the drinks mine got spilled across mine and my wife's plates, no apologies nor clean plates presented (we were required to clean the spilled drink off our own plates).  The mai tai was watered down and too much on the sweet side.  

We started with appetizers after the drink fiasco and decided to order sushi, we received our sushi and it was very hit and miss, but the bigger problem was we had no chop sticks.  We asked for chop sticks, on the first and second trips back to the table the waiter forgot the chop sticks, finally he brought them back on the third trip.  The tuna roll was pretty good, but the sushi cuts were not very good (seems the person who cut the fish needed more practice in cutting fish) and the grouper was dry and tasted a little less than fresh.

We started into soup and salad portion of the meal, the miso soup was incredibly oily (you could see the oil slick in the soup) and did not taste like much at all.  The salad while simple was very good, the ginger dressing was one of the best I have had anywhere.

I had the fillet and scallops which was in all pretty good, but I have had better.  Also the when had some of our courses during the meal I could taste some of the charred pieces of the previous course on my plate, they need to do a better job of cleaning the gill and also not use the spatula when cleaning off the grill scraper because the burnt char pieces get stuck on the spatula.  Overall the main meal tested pretty good.

We tried the fried ice cream for dessert, I think next time I will just get the fried ice cream from a Mexican restaurant, much better when they prepare it.  

Now comes a more painful part, the check, remember when I said that there were three couples?  Well all of our bills eventually got messed up.  When I ordered sushi I ordered some unagi for my wife as well, that got billed to a different couple.  We called the waiter to resolve the issue, the problem got worse.  When we got the revised bills the unagi got billed to the other couple out of the three of us and on top of that they charged the wrong cards for the meal, the second couple (the couple which now was billed the unagi) was billed on my card and my bill was billed on theirs.

We called which we assumed was the manager to try to resolve the issue, the card charge was resolved, but the unagi charge was not.  About 20 mins later we finally got some sort of remedy on the unagi charge when the manager just pretty much said here's your 5 bucks (the cost of the unagi) now get the heck out of here (not her exact words, but the impression that I got).

I am a big component on service when I have to pay this much for a meal, while I might go here again with friends and maybe for a rare special occasion I will not be back here as a casual diner.  I imagine I have had a bad experience and I imagine if/when I go back it will not be this bad (or at least I am hoping), but the management response on this was inept and pathetic.",1,"bad"
"5","Let me start by saying my family loves hibachi restaurants.  We went to Kobe tonight for my husband's birthday., because he has wanted to try it. We are new to the area and this was our first time dining here. I had called ahead for priority seating and we were seated immediately.  Any time you eat hibachi style I expect to be seated with other guests - which doesn't bother me - but they had 10 people at a table clearly meant for less and we were rubbing knees with the other guests, literally.  

The service by both the wait staff and the chef was fair.  However, I felt very rushed.  The salad was served in bowls straight from the dishwasher which immediately turned what should have been a nice cold salad into a luke warm wilted one. The grill was set at a very high setting so that everything cooked very fast, but almost burnt.  There was an odd seasoning they used in the rice that me nor my kids cared for.  My husband thought it was fine.  We had shrimp, chicken and filet.  All were good, but no real flavor to them.  They had yum-yum sauce (which totally doesn't fit the style of food - almost tastes like a special sauce at a burger joint of mayo & ketchup) and ginger sauce (only by request). People did seem to love the yum-yum sauce but we were not impressed.  The ginger sauce was very good! It seemed odd to us that they cooked the mushrooms and mixed them with the shrimp so you only got mushrooms if you ordered shrimp.  We do not care for mushrooms and would have preferred they not be in with our shrimp.  They did the same with the steak and potatoes.  The potatoes my husband got with his steak were very good, but he was the only one that got them.  The chef cooked the chicken last, which was fine, but the other guests had finished eating and I felt like I had only had my chicken for 5 minutes when I was being asked if I wanted a to-go box.  I ordered a drink when my food finally hit my plate and the waiter seemed shock/put-out by it.  Again, another instance I felt rushed.  It wasn't terrible, but I would rather not have paid $140 for an okay meal.",2,"bad"
