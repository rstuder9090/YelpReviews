"2","My roommate and I were literally laying in our beds bored and hungry and I mentioned sushi. Her face lit up and I automatically lit up seconds after seeing her light up -bottom line: we were lit for sushi. (Sorry for using young slang, we were just really pumped to grub on some sushi) so funny enough my roommate knows I use yelp for most things cause I like my food to be ~of quality~ and so she says ""do your yelp thing and let's eat some good sushi"" and I was like SAY NO MORE. So fast forward and I found that this place had good reviews (""best sushi in town"") AND it was like 3 mins away. The pictures of the sushi is what really got to me and trust me-the pictures you see are real because I experienced this sushi firsthand. It was beautiful. My roommate ordered the cowboy roll, two pieces of the salmon sushi and the chicken tempura dinner. Her chicken tempura dinner came with miso soup and a ginger salad-which came out quickly and both were yummy! She let me eat the whole salad and I thought it was bomb. We both had no complaints on the chicken which did come with fried vegetables which was all great. Moving on to the sushi-her cowboy rolls were delish!! You could tell they were fresh and just made. My roommate is a huge salmon fan (who isn't am I right?) and so she chose these rolls specifically for the salmon in them and we loved it. Her salmon sushi was also delicious. Moving on to what I ordered- from the beginning I wanted some good sushi and you bet your sushi-eating butt that that's what I got. I ordered the Volcano roll and I'm crying right now as I type this bc I'm having some post-sushi depression (I'm making that a thing now) the volcano roll absolutely quenched my thirst for sushi. It was delightful. The flavor just kinda bursts in your mouth and then there's a crunch (from the crab on top) and then before you know it you're just lying in a sushi coma. I seriously devoured this plate of sushi. And there were soooo many other rolls that I wanted to try but I thought I better save them for next time. There will definitely be a next time. Now since I haven't quite yet tried all the sushi Tampa has to offer- I won't say this is the best sushi in town BUT it got 5 stars from me. Give this place a try!! PS. My roommate and I didn't know this beforehand but on Mondays they give USF students 10% off their bill! Happy sushi eating :-)",1,"good"
"3","I had planned to try a highly-recommended Vietnamese restaurant in this same shopping center, but found they had closed early on the Saturday before Easter. Thankfully I remembered Ichiban was located nearby, and had an excellent sushi dinner instead.

Ichiban Japanese Cuisine & Sushi Bar is located in the University Collections shopping center at the intersection of Fowler Avenue and Bruce B. Downs Blvd - right near the USF campus. Even though this is a busy shopping center, the inside of the restaurant is calm and serene, with an emphasis on high quality sushi, sashimi and tempura. You'll find lots of tables and booths scattered around the restaurant, along with a traditional sushi bar and the very traditional izakaya-style of seating whereby the customers sit on tatami mats or specially-crafted seats, and dine from low tables.

Ichiban has a very nice mixture of fresh sushi and sashimi, and a wide variety of sushi / sashimi combination samplers, Bento boxes, and rice bowls. They also have a fantastic selection of rolls from the traditional California, Rainbow, and Tampa to the very exotic house special rolls found on the flip side of the menu.

My lovely date and I sat at the sushi bar and were warmly greeted by the sushi chefs with the traditional saying of ""Irasshaimase"", which is the proper Japanese way of welcoming a customer into their place of business. We responded back by saying ""Konbanwa"" or Good Evening, which raised a few smiles from the chefs. While we looked over the menu the chefs presented us with a small appetizer sample of cucumber salad in vinegar sauce. Clearly this gift was due to my amazing talent with the Japanese language.......and thankfully I did not need to embarrass myself further by mumbling my way through any other phrases. (Actually everyone who sits at the sushi bar is graced with this delicacy.)

We decided to share three different rolls for our dinner, and we felt that we made some excellent decisions. First was the S & J Roll which was spicy crab SP with tempura crunch flakes, avocado slices, rolled in nori and rice, and then topped with yellowtail (amberjack tuna). Our second roll was the Tobiko Special Roll which was made with yellowtail and scallions, rolled in nori and sushi rice, and then covered with three different types of flying fish roe (black, green, and red). This was a very colorful and delicious roll!  My personal favorite for the night was the Matt & Rosy Roll which was fresh salmon slices over a Volcano topping roll. This was clearly the salmon-lovers roll for the night! All of the food was very creative and very delicious.

They make an amazing-looking tuna martini which I want to go back and try on my next visit. Ichiban has specials on Monday nights for USF students, and I saw some terrific budget-friendly lunch specials as well.

Great little spot for those who enjoy good sushi. They menu also shows a nice mix of cooked dinner entrees -- teriyaki, grilled and broiled meats & seafood, and tempura.",2,"good"
"4","DO NOT BELIEVE any of the 4 star or above reviews here. I'm not sure what these people are seeing or eating? This place is a complete mess and in total disarray on the inside. The food is gross and the service is confusing and bad.
Went to Ichiban the other night to order for take-out. Was floored when I saw the massive mess, sloppiness, trash, and disarray the place was in. One room in plain site of the customers had a bunch of trash, equipment, decorations, etc. just scattered all over the floor. Behind the dirty looking sneeze-guard glass of where the meats/seafood for the sushi is kept, was this disheveled, unsanitary, sloppy mess. Nice touch with the fly trap on the wall behind this trough of raw seafood / meat. There was trash, empty plastic water cups, used napkins and paper towels, all over the counter where your order and by the food you are about to eat. God knows what kind of code violations and disgustingness is in the kitchen. I could go on about the rest of the restaurant...I was within one second of saying no thanks and walking away and not ordering but I was hungry and was willing to see if the food might be good. 

The workers and I'm assuming the general manager / owner there were all over the place and were not friendly or welcoming when I arrived and when placing my order. In fact, they were rude and mean as hell. Their online menu on their website does not match the menu you order from inside the restaurant; both in prices and items & descriptions. At one point, after I placed my order and was waiting, a customer (or regular guest?) came in and gave jello shots to the lady making the sushi. She used here gloved fingers to scrape the jello shot into her mouth; all the while she was making the sushi rolls. What the hell was that and who is running this place? 

As for the food - once I escaped that messy, nightmare of a restaurant; the food didn't redeem this place. They messed up my order, with giving me the wrong sushi. They gave my their spicy tuna rolls; which I didn't order but tried anyways. The tuna was very low quality and small (which was probably a good thing). No taste or flavor in any part of these sushi rolls. I also got the Sukiyaki. This was decent but they skimped on the thin sliced beef but overall it was decent. For $16 for this soup; I expected more. The Sukiyaki is pretty much just a light soup. Hey, it least it didn't get me sick. 

I know this isn't so 5-star high-end Sushi / Japanese restaurant but at the same time the prices aren't very low / inexpensive. Between the rude and bad customer service, the messiness and trashiness inside the restaurant, the very sub-par food, and just a horrible overall experience; save your money and your health and go somewhere else.",1,"bad"
"5","I would give this restaurant 1 star if it was not one of my favorite sushi spots in Tampa (prior to this visit). When I attended USF I went to this establishment frequently and always had delicious meals. I hadn't been in the area for a few years and was excited to go back. 
We ate most of our meal and had a few pieces that we were still picking at - we went for a slice of ginger and there was a black hair on the plate (neither my friend or I have black hair). We showed the server and she didn't say anything/no apology, another server came to the table and said 'It was only from the ginger. Would you like some dessert?'. We were appalled. I said 'Absolutely not, and it is unacceptable to find hair on a plate served with food.' I had no response from the server. Another person came to the table with the check, and started clearing the table of plates. As I was telling her 'We should not be responsible for that plate of food, that is unacceptable.', she spilled soy sauce from our dirty plates on my friend and my shoes. A different lady came to the table and said she gave us 10% off on that plate and that's a $27 plate so that's all she can do. 
We paid our check, but left absolutely repulsed and disappointed that we can never come back to this place. Poor, poor customer service and terrible restaurant hygeine/cleanliness. Very sad.",2,"bad"
