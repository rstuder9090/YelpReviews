"2","Extremely excellent meal! We sort of pigged out here, but the food was so good we couldn't help it.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings and edamame as appetizers. Both came out piping hot and tasted delicious. For our main dishes, I ordered the pineapple shrimp. Usually neither are my forte, especially together, but the picture on the menu looked too good to pass up. When the pineapple shrimp arrived at our table I was disappointed to find out it looked nothing like the picture. It was very good though and restored my faith in the restaurant. My husband ordered the udon soup noodles and it was just amazing( I kept stealing bites of his food lol). 

Aside from the presentation being misleading the other (minor) reasons this review is a 4 instead of a 5 are as follows. 
1. The waitress the entire meal hovered over us whenever we spoke to her( she was in my personal space and it was uncomfortable) 
2. On a Saturday night, with a half empty restaurant, the hostess gave us trouble about getting seated. 
3. After our meal, the hostess asked me if I was picking up a delivery order( very strange considering I just spent the last hour in your restaurant at a table near the hostess stand) 
4. The tiniest reason of all.... from our table I could see pictures. In the one picture frame, they kept the pictures in the frame from when they bought it. The one photo clearly has a label saying it fits photo prints of 4X6. As someone who frames a lot of photos at home, this photo frame was bought at the dollar store- lol

In any event, we can't wait to come back!",1,"good"
"3","This place for the Location is frigging awesome. Don't have to travel to the city to Mori's and waste time parking.  The quality of sushi is superb. The owner hand picks it and you can tell the difference. I have to say his Salmon is so buttery and good it's hard to duplicate. The Yellow Tail Jalape√±o is in a League of Its Own.!!!  Wasabi Roll +, Avocado Salad ++++,Salmon Sashimi Roll just to get a few good ones rolling..
