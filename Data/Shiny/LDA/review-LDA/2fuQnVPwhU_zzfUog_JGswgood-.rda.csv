"2","Two words; yummy and wholesome!! This place is a ""must try"" spot with that devout heart and soul, home-cooked, made with love, meal feel. The chef and owner of this place, who my family and I were lucky enough to meet, is a sweet, Thai mother whose abundant motherly warmth shines in her cooking. Just from that we knew why the food tastes so good! We tried the classic pad thai, pad see ewe, drunken noodles (we ordered them all with beef), tempura fried soft shell crab, and they were ALL delicious. Each noodle dish had their own flare, but had the commonality of soft, supple noodles evenly coated in their own vibrant sauce. They were very much stick to your ribs asian soul food. As dessert we had the thai tea, banana boba, and the taro boba, which were the cherry on top and great finish to the meal. The tapioca balls were cooked just right, and we all agreed that the taro one was the best from the rest. Also, to make the experience even more worth the visit was the look of the place itself. The place is very beautifully decorated with added structural work done to bring that Thai aesthetic to life. I would say more, but you will just have to witness it for yourself hehe. Anywho, I definitely would recommend you give this place a try and know you are getting a meal filled with love.",1,"good"
"3","Pad Thai is kind of a benchmark dish for Thai places.  Although it's kinda hard to mess it up, I've found it's generally a pretty good indicator of how good a place is.  Had the Pad Thai at Tin's House today, and it was fantastic.  Also had spring rolls (really good), and the soup and salad that came with the meal were good, albeit fairly standard.  I'm definitely interested in trying more from their expansive Thai menu.

And then we went with the Roti Nohm Wan (sweet milk roti) dessert.  As good as everything else was, this dessert was on a different level entirely.  Do NOT eat here without ordering this dessert.  I can't think off the top of my head of any restaurant where I would be likely to order dessert.  I will be going back to Tin's House many times, and I will be getting this dessert every single time.

Prices were fair, service was exceptional (not busy at all), food came out quickly, and the space is clean and nicely decorated.  Portions of the Pad Thai are pretty good size, which I find to be typical of most Thai restaurants.  I can't speak to the sushi or Japanese side of the menu.  I'm usually a little hesitant of places that serve more than one kind of ethnic food.  The Thai food here is terrific, so I'd be surprised if the Japanese food wasn't up to par as well.",2,"good"
