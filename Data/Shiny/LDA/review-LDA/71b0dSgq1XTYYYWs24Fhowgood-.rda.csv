One of my first poke bowls were in Atlanta and those places are swarming there. I found this place, and come to find out that's where one of the owners came from.

It's super simple order here. Where as other places I felt very overwhelmed.

I ordered sushi rice, second step ordered my protein. Two scoops which were perfect even in a small bowl which looks are deceiving and it was quite enough!! Picked tuna and salmon, then picked  cucumber and seaweed salad(yum yum yum), then picked my additional toppings(I didn't pay extra either). Picked pineapple, masago, sesame seeds, and their house dressing!!!!

And I'm a happy Aloha Poke Bowl customer! A+++

They have a few tables inside and outside. I brought it with me, and skipped to Limani to sit by the water while my hubby had his lunch. 

Perfect perfect!! Thanks Aloha Poke!!",1,"good"

Lovely gentleman behind the counter was very helpful, walked us through the layout at the counter. I've had poke before, my significant other had not (typically a burger and fries kinda guy) - he opted for cooked shrimp and chicken, some veggies, avocado and got the hook up on sauces - and he devoured his when we got home. 

TIP: If you like heat, do not pass on the house-made wasabi, and DO get the hook up on sauces! 

Two downsides, but only because Poke was my favorite takeout option in California: 1.] It was disappointing that the toppings (aside from proteins) were limited to 3-4 choices per deli section (I'm all about crisp veggies and flavors from places that let you build your own). 2.] It was a little pricey for the size that the large was ($35 for two large bowls... which was all that we had purchased). Removed half star for each, as this would not prevent me from coming back. :)

Overall VERY tasty, and very filling!!",2,"good"
