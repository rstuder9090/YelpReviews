"2","Ninki has renewed my faith in Japanese food in Nashville.  

I am a card carrying Japanese Food Snob.  I lived in Japan for three years, my wife is Japanese, I cook and eat Japanese food all the time.  Nashville has never had a Japanese restaurant that really stood up to my unreasonable expectations.  Until now, until Ninki.  

I went to the Grand Opening event that was unfortunately scheduled on May 5th.  If you speak Spanish or just like an excuse to drink and eat chips and salsa you understand why that might be a challenge for a Japanese restaurant.  Nonetheless the meal and the evening were fantastic.

Ninki is located in the shopping center next to the Belle Mead Kroger on West End.  From the outside it is rather unassuming and will take a while for the locals to catch on to.  Inside it is very sleek and elegant.  There are two separate dining areas since they offer both Hibachi and a more traditional sushi and Japanese food menu.  Overall I found the atmosphere to be very appealing place to spend time and enjoy a meal.  

The menu is broad and covers a lot of ground.  I did not have the Hibachi so I cannot review that part of the restaurant. They have a full sushi menu and a great selection of unique Japanese specialties.  I love a good hibachi, but with as good as the rest of the menu is I don't know if I will ever make it to the Ninki hibachi tables.  

If I had one recommendation for the menu at Ninki it would be to go exploring.  They offer multiple dishes that are unique and definitely not offered anywhere else in Nashville or at almost any Japanese restaurant that I have been to in the US.  Our group was fortunate enough to be seated with some friends of the chef so we got to sample most of the specialties on the menu.  All of them were excellent and made me wish I had a bigger stomach.  A quick recap of the meal is as follows:

Salmon Ceviche Salad with shaved parmigiana and a wonderful dressing;  Hon Maguro Tuna, the real deal and the best sushi I have had in Nashville;  Duck Breast served Jibu-ni style which apparently means with a delicate mushroom sauce and grilled scallions, fantasic;  Black Cod baked with vegetables in a paper wrapper which might have been the single best piece of fish I have ever had, moist and unbelievably full of flavor;  Ribeye steak cooked on a ripping hot stone and flambed with cognac;  Creme Brule;  French Wine; Beer ; Lobster roll Sushi; Chocolate Cake.  

Honestly it is a miracle I was able to get up, but everything was perfectly sized and impossible to resist.  

Ninki left me completed satisfied and more than a little impressed.  It is not a cheap place to eat, but it is worth every penny and then some.  If you are a traditionalist the sushi is excellent and will definitely not disappoint.  If you want to experiment then there is a wealth of great food waiting to be discovered.  Explore the menu at Ninki.  There are things there that cannot be had anywhere else in Nashville.",1,"good"
"3","Here's my quick and dry review of this place, which I USED to frequent about once per week.

I rated 4 out of 5, based on my experiences with other sushi restaurants in Nashville, because it is unfair to compare to some of the other sushi restaurants I've been to while living in Manhanttan, NY. 

I usually rate sushi based on three criteria. Rice, Fish, and Presentation.

Here, the sushi rice is of good consistency and taste. Not too dry, not too mushy. Good overall texture. Not too sweet or too much vinegar, but seasoned right for my palate.

Here, the fish is always consistent. Fresh and vibrant in color. The raw scallop is so-so.  Sea urchin is good. Occasionally, they have specialty fish like Toro. The nigiri fish is sliced appropriately, in terms of size and thickness. Acceptable fish to rice ratio, but could be more delicate.

Here, the presentation is average. I'm not expecting much, particularly since the prices are average. Again, not delicate but acceptable.

As others mentioned, the location (in a strip mall) is quite deceiving. I would have skipped this place had I not stumbled upon it by accident. The interior is ok decorated with appropriate lighting. If it's busy, it can get a bit noisy inside due to the high ceilings and large interior space. 

Service is average, friendly. Sometimes a bit slow when busy, but expected. Sometimes when it's busy, they look clueless. 

They have sake, wine and specialty drinks, but I cannot comment on this since I get water.

I love raw fish and shellfish. I love toro, hamchi and mirugai. Sadly for me, people in Nashville tend to favor the more common fish so this place doesn't carry the more selective fishes/shellfish on a regular basis. Ninki sometimes sells the fatty salmon skin, which I HIGHLY recommend. I typically order the nigiri or the chirashi here because ANY specialty rolls tend to mask the flavor of the rice and fish. I realize this may be desirable for some, but I prefer the raw taste. I eat all my raw seafood without any garnish - no cocktail sauce, lemon, nothing. Only wasabi and soy sauce. Sometimes, without it too.

 If I'm on a budget that day, I'll stick to ordering their maki rolls since it's always 50% off for dine-in customers. 

The hibachi is so-so.  Not my favorite, but I come here for the sushi.

Ok, so maybe this wasn't a quick review. Too bad we can't do a powerpoint presentation, complete with animation. 

I'll end by saying this...the place is Japanese owned and operated. Why is this important? Because it is.",2,"good"
