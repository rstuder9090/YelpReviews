"2","As I preface any review of a Chinese restaurant, I grew up in NY with some of the best Chinese food in NY city. I usually only go to and review places with a menu of traditional dishes I grew up with. One place that has a nice menu is Trey Yan and Wu. Right off the bat I noticed a number of my favorite dishes. Granted they may be a little more on the pricey side but worth it to get the quality and flavor of delicious dishes without having to go to NYC or Philadelphia.
 
We had a table of 5 adults and 2 small children and service was impeccable and the servers very friendly. We started with the Pink Lady and Bossy Lady sushi rolls as appetizers. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the teriyaki beef skewers. My skewer was tender beef but one person did complain her piece was a little chewy but she was the only one. Still great flavor.
 
Can't complain about any dish we got. Everyone, including friends who never had these dishes before loved them ... beef chow fun, beef pan fried noodles (one of my all-time favorite dishes and hard to find), peking duck, and saut√©ed baby bok choy with garlic. The one pricey item was the peking duck at $20 with 6 crepes, the table absolutely loved it but I would have liked to have gotten more meat from a half duck but not complaining too much. The skin was crispy and the meat tender. One dish the table decided to try was the honey walnut shrimp. It was good but not worth $20 to me.
 
Overall a very pleasant and delicious outing and would highly recommend for those who want to try some different Chinese dishes not found in every chinese restaurant.",1,"good"
"3","Dear uneducated, racist/ignorant people that just casually surf Yelp without knowing the difference between Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Thai food:

In case you haven't noticed, this restaurant is owned by Cantonese-speaking Chinese people and predominantly serve food inspired by the Sinitic mainland. Sure, restaurants nowadays like to capitalize on the fact that most Americans that have never been abroad cannot distinguish between what's authentic and what's watered-down and offer dishes that are slightly outside of their taste palate (e.g. Chinese/Korean restaurants that serve Japanese food; Chinese ""pho"" restaurants, etc.) but if you're a smart consumer, you don't go into McDonalds and order the salad and expect for it to be the best thing in the world. Or go to Olive Garden and expect the pizza/tomato pie to be better than LL Spumoni's or Uno's (the real one in Chicago, not the grille franchise)

That being said, one should know better than to be ignorant enough to order Sushi/sashimi from a Chinese restaurant and have an epiphany regarding the futility of said act, and then try to mask the newfound shame through an uninformative, lackluster Yelp review centered on loaded and negative phrases.

Now that I'm done being a Negative Nancy, on to the actual review.

I don't quite know what part about this restaurant is very yan and what part of it is wu, but it seems to be working well for the restaurant itself. Yes, the restaurant is slightly pricier than your run-of-the-mill delivery/takeout Chinese restaurant, and to miss the fact that TY&W is not one of the aforementioned establishments, you'd be a square. The interior of the restaurant is very well decorated, and has the air of elegance to it; all the wait staff don white button-up shirts and trim black pants, which did make me feel slightly underdressed, but they didn't seem to mind it anyhow.

Service was excellent and on that note, to people that complain about the lack of service or the quality of service in Chinese restaurants: if you ever go to China, to get any service in ANY restaurant period (save the ones frequented by the upper/middle class) you have to yell ""Waiter/Waitress"" and yell at the top of your lungs and pray to dog they heard you. It's actually kind of like a bar -- you try your darndest to establish eye contact and communiation with your server and then pray to Buddha that you don't end up with the runs within the next two hours. 

In any case, the waitress was very friendly and attentive to our culinary needs.

The food here--so long as you figure out that they're a Chinese restaurant and you should order things that Chinese people like to eat--is outstanding. We ordered the eggplant, stir-fried bok choy in ginger/garlic sauce, (which was replaced with Chinese cauliflower because they ran out of bok choy) beef and scallops in pepper sauce, and because I was at dinner with non-Asian people, Thai Shrimp. The chef was also more than willing to cook up an egg and scallion fried rice for us even though it wasn't on the menu, which, along with the rest of the meal, was probably some of the best Chinese food I'd had in Jersey.

TY&W probably benefits from the fact that they're located in Mount Laurel, NJ and not Philly Chinatown, but it's a solid choice if you love Chinese food and are tired of eating it out of silly paper/styrofoam containers.

Oh, and BYOB.",2,"good"
