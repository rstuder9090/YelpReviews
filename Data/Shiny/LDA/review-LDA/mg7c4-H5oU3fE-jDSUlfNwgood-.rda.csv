"2","Been trying to get take out from here for several weeks but had difficulty due to quarantine restrictions. Lucked out today getting my order! They were not offering delivery at the time so I do carry out, making the order was a little difficult due mainly to a lil language barrier and I think the person taking my order was a bit stressed rushing me through my order and getting card info, just seemed in a panic and stressed. Street parking was easy but probably not always, I followed instructions and called 20 minutes after placing my order, came to the door and was greeted by a table blocking the door and 3 8x10 letters explaining directions. The man came to the table with my order and set it in front of me but this guy was flexing serious PPE including a large apron, face mask, safety glasses, aaaaaaand a plastic disposable tuber wear lid strapped to his face. He set the food down and yelled some random indistinguishable directions and walked off. I assumed he forgot something so I paced in front of the door for several minutes where I got to take in the sights, smells, and experience the wonderful homeless of downtown Indy wanting money or cigarettes from me. Finally the Asian man came back with another order and started yelling at me through the door, apparently I was supposed to sign the receipt, take the food and go, I should have probably the signs while I stood there. A funny experience picking up food in Covid19 quarantine times. The star of the show was the food though! I posted pictures and everything we had was excellent. Once things blow over this will be a go to place for us, just have to expect a lil crazy placing and picking up food.",1,"good"
"3","Let me start by saying that if I wrote this review after my first 3 times eating here, I would have rated this a 2 or maybe at tops a 3 star. My only reason for visiting prior was convenience, delivery, and the guilty pleasure once every month or two of sugary americanized chinese cuisine. 

Now let me follow by saying why I ended up rating this establishment a 5 star. AUTHENTIC CHINESE MENU. I was fortunate enough to meander in and see a large table of 8 Chinese people eating dishes that I had no idea this place had, nor are readily available by normal menu. My mouth was watering. I scanned page to page of the menu without much luck of seeing anything authentically chinese. I finally asked the server about a chinese menu, and he smiled at me in a ""hell yea bro"" fashion before preceding to bring me an entirely separate menu written in mandarin with occasional English descriptions. I ordered Sichuan style twice cooked pork and a sichuan style chili chicken and the food was quite good. The quality of the chicken was better than most, as was all white meat. The spice was spot on, and felt as I was in Chinatown or even Bloomington IN where much better authenticity reigns. I left a satisfied individual, excited to return. 

To end, do not waste too much time with the americanized Chinese here, go for the gold with authentic menu. I really believe this place would thrive just going balls to the walls with their authentic menu and inter mixing the americanized options within as Indianapolis is becoming more diverse and culturally seasoned!",2,"good"
