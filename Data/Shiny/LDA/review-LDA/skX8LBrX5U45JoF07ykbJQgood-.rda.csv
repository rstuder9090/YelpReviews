"2","I met a friend here for lunch and they have great lunch specials! Each lunch comes with a soup and a salad. I had sushi and my friend had teriyaki chicken and rice. I can honestly say we were both stuffed when we left!
The sushi for the lunch special is a more simple roll but it was delicious. They have a wide variety of ""fancy"" sushi rolls too, just not part of the lunch special.

There is inside and outside seating. We sat outside because it was still cool enough to do so. They also have a big awning so it is not in direct sun.

The server was very attentive and friendly.

One thing to know if you are using an ap to find it, the location is off. E-sushi is in the building in front of Publix. Your app will send you past the turn and you will probably have to make a u-turn to come back.

It is a little far from my work, but I would definitely come here again. I may also look at getting takeout.",1,"good"
"3","Why 4 stars? Because this is a nice dining option in an area not known for those.

This was another recently discovery when searching for newer businesses relatively near me that I bookmarked not too long ago. I used all of Thanksgiving week to go crazy and eat whatever I wanted with no restriction to give myself a break from trying to eat pretty healthy. This was my final meal before shutting it back down and returning to fat burning mode.

We enjoyed it overall, but this is what 4-star reviews were made for. The meal was nice, but nothing overwhelmed us. 

The Sweet Mango roll was just okay. I ordered it because it was a bit unique, but there's probably a reason mangos and fish don't mix. It wasn't weird or anything, but the flavors didn't exactly bring out the best in each other.

The Volcano Roll was messy but tasty. And the Lobster General Roll was enjoyable, but just a warning for those who don't like this sort of thing, the seaweed taste was a bit stronger in this one.

My wife ordered chicken teriyaki, which was fine. It came with a *ton* of chicken - I don't think she even ate half, despite me helping. The fried rice was the best part.

Next time I'm craving sushi, I'll probably opt for one of my favorite places nearby, but I'm happy for the people who live nearby in an area where good local restaurants are hard to come by.",2,"good"
