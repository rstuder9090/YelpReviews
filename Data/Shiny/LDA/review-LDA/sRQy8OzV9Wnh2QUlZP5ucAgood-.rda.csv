"2","i've been wanting to try this megu since it opened and finally went today with my mom 

it was a pretty good dinner, we ordered a bunch of stuff like tako su, rock shrimp, kara age, eggplant and scallop, tropical summer rolls... then we had the central park roll, lobster roll, and oyster roll... everything was delicious especially the rock shrimp-- definitely very similar to the ny style ones

i was surprised by the ""OYSTER ROLL"", i've never had it until today and it turns out fried oyster is a decent ingredient for sushi too, megu used a splash of mayo with it and cucumber in the sushi... a very good mix-- i actually think i might prefer the oyster roll over the spider roll (with soft shell crab) from now on

tropical summer rolls were one of their recommendation not on the menu, it was alrite, if you like summer rolls, i would definitely recommend that, it's the typical veggies with crab and mayo and apple wrapped together.  i don't like mint leaves so this turned out to be a better pick for me

i really liked the ""TAKO SU"", which is octopus in ponzu (japanese vinegar) sauce on top of seaweed.  very refreshing, great appetizer to start with, and the seaweed gives a great texture almost like a bouncy crunch in your month to loosen your jaw for your meal to come.

""LOBSTER ROLL"" was delicious too, a roll made on a lighter note.. meaning no spiciness, no mayo, no sauce.. it held a very fresh taste, i could definitely taste the lobster apart from the rest of the ingredients

i would pass on the ""CENTRAL PARK ROLL"" which is a spicy toro roll really... i didn't really see a difference between that and a spicy tuna roll other than the price... 

we also got the ""EXOTIC BOMBE"" which is 3 different flavored sorbet ice cream covered in white chocolate in the shape of a ball.  great dessert for the summer.

overall, i was quite pleased with the experience, i would definitely come back esp when they have their sushi special on sun and mon",1,"good"
"3","On a recent trip to NJ I was treated to a meal here by a local friend of the person I was rooming with, and I must say it was a lovely experience! Immediately I appreciated the cool, peaceful atmosphere when we walked in, and that initial positive impression continued throughout the evening. We were given a pretty tan booth to sit in and some spiced cucumbers to much on while we perused the menu. Our server was pleasant and clearly explained the special rolls available that day. Once she'd opened our ros√© (the place is BYOB) we placed our orders. 

I went with this Japanese version of Pad Thai that I was curious to try, since I've already eaten my fair share of sushi and sashimi over the years and nothing on the menu looked super adventurous or different. It was smoky and delicious, but didn't have Thai sauce on it. Instead the sauce was brown, and there appeared to be eggplant and mushrooms mixed in with the noodles. I thought it was wonderful overall! My friends had special rolls, one was eel and the other was a lobster roll. I tried the lobster one and it was tasty, but not really my cup of tea...I prefer straight sashimi honestly. Too much tempura and garnish and the flavors are lost to me. However it seemed really fresh and well-made, so for people who like special rolls this places makes a good one! 

As we finished our meal we were able to relax and chat for the better part of an hour. Our leftovers were quickly boxed up by the staff once we were ready to leave, but nothing ever felt rushed. It ended up being one of the longest dinners I've had in a while, thanks to the overall hospitable atmosphere of Megu. I would go back in a heartbeat!",2,"good"
