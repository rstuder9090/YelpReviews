"2","Gachi Sushi & Noodles (8/10) is a nice, small sushi bar eatery that offers a wide selection of sushi and ramen dishes. Overall, a promising lunch venue especially if you want a nice bowl of noodles. They have two locations; today I went to the one at Terminal A.

AMBIANCE: (8.5/10)  It is a nice small quick stop restaurant with a nice bar seating area if you aren't in a rush.  The location is very quaint and in one of less busy parts of the airport, so it's a great place if you want a bit of quiet in the airport. I felt like I was able to relax and enjoy my meal without having to rush or worry about loud announcements interrupting my meal. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: (9/10) The staff is very friendly and attentive. I was offered seating promptly and my order was taken quickly. All the seating options were properly set up and had a very nice and clean presentation. Food came out in roughly 10 mins, so great timing on their part. 

FOOD: (7/10) 
Tonkatsu Ramen with Pork and Boiled Egg ($13 +$2 for the egg)
I previously saw some mixed reviews mentioning the ramen, so I decided to try it myself. It came out as a sizable portion, and I only managed to eat about 2/3 of it. It comes with only 3 pieces of meat, so I wish it came with more but it was reasonable. The meat was a bit chewy, but it still had lots of seasoning and flavor in it. The boiled egg was also very good although it tasted a bit salty. Overall the flavor of the super was powerfully flavorful but with a bit too much sodium for my personal tasting. This includes the broth which felt a little overbearing. Aside from the extra sodium that I tasted the other flavors worked very well together. The broth was nice and hot which was perfect for this cold day and it mixed well with the veggies (great complementary texture) along with the flavors from the meat. It would have been a higher rating from me if there were a bit more meat and a little less salty taste.",1,"good"
"3","I never thought I would give a airport restaurant five stars! I stumbled across Gachi when stuck in the Philadelphia airport. There were several flights delayed and the airport was bustling from 9pm to 2am when the last flight left. Even though the airport was full, big name restaurants in the airport were giving last call on food and beverages, but not Gachi. 
I was pleasantly surprised to find out they severed wine and they had delicious, fresh seafood. I had the franklin, which consisted of salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, and seaweed salad. The sushi was well priced, plentiful, and delicious. There is very limited seating in this spot but the staff also offered to take the food and beverage to go! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone traveling though the E terminal at Philadelphia airport!",2,"good"
