"2","I have been getting take-out regularly from To-Kai for the past few years.  This is my second review as I want to let everyone know about my past experiences with them in the past few years.

-PROS:
Food: The food at To-Kai is outstanding. It's always fresh and I have never had a bad experience. Here are some of my favorite items that I recommend to try:

a)      Tuna pizza - Delicious. It's avacado, tuna, and crab on top of a crispy tortilla and it just melts in your mouth, it is so good! So many different textures, i always get this.
b)      Agedashi Tofu - Very delicately fried tofu in a sweet soy dipping sauce. It is really good and doesn't taste greasy or anything.
c)     Dumpling Soup - very soft dumplings in a delicious broth, i wish they put more dumplings in it, thats how much i love this soup!
d)     Kani Salad - Delicious, it's crab, masago, cucumber and japanese mayo. It's also a little spicy as well. Very different than you're typical kani salads that ive tried before at other places.
e)     Bigeye Tuna - Very fresh and delicious. I always get the higher quality tuna when they have it available as it's more fatty and it taste really good. But it's also more expensive.
f)    KO-BE Beef - Delicious, however i don't think it's real kobe beef from japan, thats why they spell it KO-BE. However it is very thin sliced high quality beef that's in a delicious garlic sauce. I love it.
g)    Filet mignon in Thai Basil sauce - One of the best entrees on the menu. The beef is super high quality and they always cook it perfectly. It is a filet mignon in a thai basil sauce. It is really good and the sauce really brings out the dish.
h)   Crunchy roll - One of the best rolls to try on the menu  - Shrimp tempura, cucumber and masago w masago and tempura flakes on top. It's very good and has a great texture.

Ambiance:  The place has great ambiance and decor.  I very rarely eat here in person but if I did i wouldn't mind staying here a while as the place has a very modern and chic decor.

Service: Can't comment on it since I only get take-out.

CONS:
-Prices are a big high compared to other sushi places in NE Philly. However I think the freshness and variety of the food makes up for the prices.  Plus they offer a rewards program, you need to get your menu stamped each time you pay and if you spend $200 you get a free $20 gift certificate. Sure I wish that were higher, but it adds up!

-When ordering take-out on a Friday or Sat. night between the hours of 6-8pm it gets extremely busy and picking up my order could take up to 45 mins. I would also not advise eating here during those hours as the place is packed and there are a lot of people waiting for a seat.",1,"good"
"3","Dunno what the lower reviews are about, we just had a great dinner there on 050811, a very busy saturday night. May have been a situational (one-time) fluke - - but excellent fish and service are not easily flukes - they are usually products of consistently excellent management. Note the good and excellent reviews also on urbanspoon, philadelphia.menupages.com. So Kudos to the owners and staff team. 

We had quick service, all food really excellent, and we are a sashimi/sushi queen & king from WDC area with plenty of sushi had in NYC, San Fran and San Diego during our travels. The quality of the fish we had was very fresh and excellent. We all had sushi or sashimi. Generous sashimi cuts on the deluxe platter. Bento boxes were greatly enjoyed and a good deal. We tried some fancy chef specialties (yellowtail, etc.) and assorted sashimi & sushi - all excellent quality.  Appetizers and rolls are innovative, and they have the usual fish and entrees as well... Good presentation. They even have shiso leaves, hurray (great with ika and some other things)! Next time if it's in season, I'll try their uni, the acid test!

Only complaint is minor: Salad's sauce ginger flavor was too mild, but that may be to appeal to mainstream people. Avocado salad could have used more avocado (which was right ripeness) and less iceberg lettuce - how about putting it over cucumber and radish sprouts? Anyway, everything else was wonderful.

There was a very happy party in the hibachi room (and note - the glass doors between that party room and the rest of the restaurant can be closed to reduce noise to conversational levels). Looked like so much fun we hadn't had in a long time (old fogies!) that we said we'd try the hibachi room next time, even though normally we are sushi die-hards and picky about it... 

By the way, there was a green wasabi pickle condiment (not talking the wasabi paste here!) to die for if you love wasabi flavor - hot but very good flavor - appears to be horseradish shoots, or at least that what it looks like. Some kind of wasabi-zuke? Flavor and heat seemed to make it sure it was not a wasabi-(flavored) pickled other vegetable, though it may have been. Anyway  SURE wish I had the recipe. Couldn't stop eating it (carefully) and took its leftovers home which was great (with, I admit it, a hot dog and saurkraut! no fish at home at present, so I experimented).  

Normally we don't care about decor, we are foodies and focus on the food. However it's worthy to mention the environment here: The modern decor in the main room is really neat, would look good on HGTV show - sculptural-wavy white, lit accent wall, shiny bead curtains in moderation, a bottle rack lit with colors behind, etc. - but NOT overdone - it's tasteful. Pleasant visually while still very japanese restaurant - it's kinda hip. Real japan, korea etc. are cosmopolitan as well as traditional - so this place was refreshing compared to staid same old canned japanese-style restaurant decor - thanks to the owners for the decor. 

Drink menu and sakes look intriguing and good, but we weren't there to try them that night. 

Parking lot was no problem, unlike in the city itself. 

Good english by staff. Great birthday candle (the little gizmo was subject of amusing engineering conversation afterwards).  Service was very responsive; didn't overdo or underdo, just right, there to catch our signals or handle cleanup or refills as needed. 
Prices are moderate and reasonable - dinner entres 12-20 bucks per.  If you ate sushi/sashimi a la carte and a lot of it, it could be expensive, but so would any other fine quality sushi place.",2,"good"
"4","I was genuinely surprised and not surprised with my experiences at To-Kai. The oyster shooters were by far the best shooters that I've had in a long time (surprised). There raw oyster was balanced with the right amount of alcohol. I was warned ahead of time that sushi rolls were not that impressive, but I ordered a special roll anyways. Let's just say I was not impressed (not surprised). A heavy reliance on sauces, and the seaweed used to wrap the roll was not crispy. When ordering sushi here, one should request for fresh wasabi (surprised). This isn't readily available everywhere, and it adds a different kind of heat to the sushi. 

In all honesty, if you're going to To-Kai you should just order everything from its Appetizers section and just disregard everything else, but even the Appetizer section can leave you wanting more. The tuna pizza was thoroughly enjoyed at my table, but personally, there was once again a heavy reliance on sauce for this app. The kani salad was really good - refreshing with a nice kick. The avocado blossom was the highlight for me. It packed some nice flavors while maintaining some textural components (everything was just mush). The baked mussels were so-so. The quality of the mussels played a big part on why I didn't like them. The mussels were just so small and then you add a bunch of stuff on top and bake it; the results are over-cooked, shriveled mussels with too much toppings.",1,"bad"
"5","Horrible experience!!! I went to this 
 place cause my brothers girlfriend is Japanese and she was visiting philly for the first time and we want to take her to dinner as soon as she landed cause she was starving. We decide to take her to this rest cause i heard was good and also is not far from home. but what a disappointment. The place close at 11:00 he arrive a little bit late at 10:06 to be exact, the service was horrible. I mean if you want to go home all ready why they just said is close and don't take any custumers because if they are going to be rushuing,the cook in the table all rushing the food slapy so just don't take customer. It was a lady that was standing next to us all the time looking at us with out moving and making us unconfortable to the point that we did not enjoy the food at all. Plus they was c;leaning next to us and you could see the dust particles flaying to our plates. The waiter never ask us if we want refill for our drinks or  desert of is anything all right like you expect in a good restaurant. We where a group of 6 my brother his girlfriend,my parents,my grandmother and i. Hiroko my brothers girlfriend told them that they were rude i mean we spend almost 300.00 dollars that night and for that horrible service is not acceptable. They need to treat the costumer better. Is not all about the money. Is much more that comes with it.",2,"bad"
