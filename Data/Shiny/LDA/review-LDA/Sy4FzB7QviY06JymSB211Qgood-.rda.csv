"2","Beautifully presented sushi! And tastes good too. Sushi places often have great presentation of their rolls, but this place had us oohing and ahhing every time they brought out another plate. (They used props with LED lighting and flowers.) All of my group chose sushi off the menu, as opposed to the all-you-can-eat option. I had the cowboy roll, which isn't something I normally would have picked, but it didn't disappoint. Steak, tempura fried shrimp and mango wrapped in soy paper. Delicious! I don't usually talk about textures in food, but this had a crunch to it that was both surprising and delightful. I might even say that the cowboy roll is my new favorite sushi roll in town. I also enjoyed the Mexican roll, which was somewhat spicy, but it was hard for it to top the other food on my plate.

My friend had an extravagant looking sashimi dish, served on a bowl of ice, complete with decorative LED ice cubes to liven it up. They also had several vegetarian options with a good 3 for $12 deal on veggie rolls. There were also a few interesting ones that we didn't get to try. Fruit roll? A roll with fried plantain?? There were so many interesting choices on the list, that I'll most definitely be back to try some more.

Service was good. Ambience was nice, quiet. It's a small space, but they were able to accommodate our group of 8 with no problem. No liquor/alcohol license yet (as of 12/6/18), so you won't find sake, wine or beer here.",1,"good"

When I pulled into this strip mall at 111th and Allisonville Road, I was surprised how many restaurants were clustered together.  I was able to find a space out front of Kasai and since it was around 1 pm, I was able to get a seat right away.  The waitress/hostess brought two separate menus:  The first was for ordering from their wide variety of items and included some lunch specials at the back; the second were some laminated checklists for the all you can eat program.  You have to choose before you order....crossing in and out is not allowed.  So, you will have to read some other review of how they thought the all you can eat menu compares.  I didn't need to get stuffed, so I simply went with one of the lunch specials.  So glad I did!

The lunch special comes with a bowl of Miso soup and a side salad with Ginger Dressing (note that they dress it for you and could scale back on how much they use.)  I upgraded the Miso to a Hot and Sour Soup for an extra $1.  I also got to choose two 6-pc rolls:  Eel Roll and Spicy Crunchy (crab) Roll.

The salad came out first and was a true side salad:  mostly iceberg lettuce (crisp) and some small colorful ingredients like a cherry tomato, carrot and red cabbage strips.  The ginger dressing was really good, but I left a lot of it on the bottom of the bowl.  The waitress asked if I preferred a fork which I did, and she brought it over right away.

When the soup came out next, I was surprised how large the serving was.  I'm guessing it was two full cups and it was steaming hot!  I kept stirring it to cool it down because the waitress cautioned me that it was hot.  So, I drink some green tea while waiting.

Before I had made much of a dent in the soup, the two rolls arrived.  So I alternated between bites of the soup, bites of the rolls, and some pickled ginger.

The soup was just thick enough to give it some heartiness.  It had strips of veggies and mushrooms and just a bit of spicy heat on the back of the palate.  Very manageable for me, but maybe a bit too hot for what my wife would want.  I found it perfectly spiced for me.

The crab filled spicy crunch roll had a really nice balance of flavors, especially when dipped in soy sauce.  The eel had a bit more sweetness from the eel sauce, which was again balanced by the salt in the soy sauce.  I found both very fresh tasting, not a hint of fishiness odor or taste.  Good stuff!  The pieces were bite sized, not some over stuffed roll that you can't fit into your mouth.  

I've begun eating my sushi without using chopsticks.  I read somewhere that it should be ""finger food"" and so I've eliminated the frustration of trying to pick up a piece (intact) with chopsticks.  If you struggle with chopsticks like I do, just pick it up and eat it.  It's your food...it's okay!

Very pleasant service without being intrusive.  I would gladly go back!
