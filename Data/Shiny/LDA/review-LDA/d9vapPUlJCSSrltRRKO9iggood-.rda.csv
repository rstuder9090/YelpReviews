"2","Had dinner here on a Monday evening while I was in town on a business trip.

Service was fast and attentive. I had their $19.99 sushi special, which includes 10 pieces of Nigiri and a tuna roll. I asked the chef if he would change out the tuna roll for a spicy tuna roll, and he went one better and recommended the crunchy spicy tuna roll. Very good call; the roll was delicious.

The special included salad (just lettuce with dressing) and miso soup. Salad wasn't anything special but the miso was hot and tasty.

The rest of the special was good. Fish was fresh and quantities were good. My only comment is that it would have been nice if the chef or waitress had shown me exactly which types of fish were served, as it's pretty much chef's choice. I do know that it included two tuna, a yellow tail, a Krab (I don't think it was authentic but it might have been), an octopus, a salmon, and what I think was mackerel (it was a pretty pungent, oily fish). 

I enjoyed my meal here and would definitely recommend it to others. At $20 the sushi special is a pretty good value, quality and quantity was just right, and service was excellent.",1,"good"
"3","Close to my house, good service, decent prices, and decent food.  I'll probably be back.

I placed a to-go order on a Wednesday night.  She said it would be ready in 10 minutes, and I warned them that I wouldn't be there for 20-25 minutes.  She said she'd delay it so it wouldn't sit out.  I got there in 20 minutes, and they had everything together except the ice cream, which she pulled from the freezer (only took 1-2 minutes) and I left happy.  

When I got home, I noticed two problems.  First, the bag smelled very fishy.  Second, there was no soy sauce.  Well, ok, I have soy sauce in my fridge, so that problem was solved.  And, after some investigation, I discovered that the fishy smell was coming from the miso soup, not the sushi.  

Despite the smell, the miso soup was pretty good.  I've definitely had better, but it was definitely not the worst, either.  

I ordered a rainbow roll and chirashi, my standard order when trying a new place.  I also ordered some ice cream for later.  The ice cream was the only thing that wasn't well-priced: surprisingly expensive at $4.50.  Without that, my 'normal' order came to around $30.  

The rainbow roll was pretty good: the fish was fresh and flavorful.  The chirashi was also good EXCEPT for the hamachi, which was definitely on it's way out.  I didn't eat it.  I think there is maybe a problem with the supplier in the area, since this is the second sushi place this week that's had problems with hamachi.  I think I will avoid any further hamachi sushi until spring.  That said, assuming you avoid the hamachi, all the rest of the fish was quite good and fresh (not great, but good), and the price was good, too. 

Service - 4.5 stars (would have been 5 if it weren't for the missing soy sauce)
Price - 4 stars
Food - 3 stars

To be fair, I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, so I have very high standards.  However, there are two other sushi places in Tampa that I give 5 stars for the food (I Ai & Sushi Cafe), so it's not impossible.  Still, this is far better than Takara, and closer to my house than the other two, so I'll probably be back.",2,"good"
