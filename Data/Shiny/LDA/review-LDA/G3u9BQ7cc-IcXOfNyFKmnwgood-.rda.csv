"2","I add another location to my 5-star choices - the latest Wasabi location on Manchester in Warson Woods just west of Rock Hill and Brentwood.

When we arrived last Saturday before Valentine's Day at 6pm, it was a 45-min wait!  Wow!  We couldn't wait that day, but the hostess told us as we left that they do take reservations.  (I haven't made one yet, so I can't confirm this.)

So without reservations, we tried a slower night and were seated without a wait.  We started with the house green tea.  We received two cups, a sand timer, and a clear pitcher full of tea.  When the sand runs down, you're ready.  You place the pitcher on top of your made-to-fit cup, and it dispenses the tea from the bottom directly into your cup.  Replacing the pitcher on the table amazingly leaves no ring or moisture at all.  The tea was good with a particularly nutty smell and contained brown rice among the tea leaves.  Later, they did offer to refill our pitcher with more hot water, and it seemed like it wouldn't be an additional charge.

With an order of only 3 rolls, our salad was a la carte.  (The server mentioned it was possible to get soup/salad free with 4 or more rolls.)  I LOVE these salads with ginger dressing.

Then an appetizer of gyoza, which was perfectly done.

Finally, our sushi rolls arrived on a platter in the middle of the table.  Upon friends' recommendations, we chose the M&B II (with barbecued eel) and the Clayton from the ""Latest Menu Additions"" insert.  Both were very good.  The description for the Clayton mentions ""spicy"" but it's extremely tame, and that's coming from someone who tops out at Del Taco's mild sauce.

There was a 3rd sushi roll.  The local special at this location is called The Manchester, which we had to write in on our order sheet.  You can view the description on the sign near the front.  It is jam-packed with tasty ingredients, and we both liked it more than The Clayton or the M&B II.

If I remember correctly, the tea was around $5 and about the same for the gyoza.  I don't recall the salad price, and each roll was around $11.  They have less expensive rolls, but they just contain fewer ingredients and toppings.

Service was friendly and attentive.  Great experience!  Looking forward to coming back!",1,"good"

The place is decently decorated, with crystal, wood and china, and artwork on the walls, soft and warm light and pleasant scent, and the fish tank of course... It is a pleasing place to be in for relaxing when there are fewer people, but turns into insanely chaotic mayhem during peak hours, or when there are screaming babies or baseball fans yelling at the televisions. 5/5

Service 2/5. We have been here thrice. Our second visit (3 months ago), the hostess left immediately after we were seated, with nothing on the table. We had to flag someone down multiple times to get our chopsticks and napkins. There were only five customers and it took 38.4 minutes to make a Chirashi. We asked why we didn't get our miso soup she said 'Oh I'm so sorry, I just got here and I didn't know'. Yesterday, our third visit, the hostess forgot the miso soup also because she is newly recruited. Lucky coincident, we just discovered the identical twin sister of the hostess three months ago.
