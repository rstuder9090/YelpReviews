"2","My wife is the Sushi Sensei.  What she likes about Sake as she can easily change her route home and stop there for the happy hour specials if I've had a big lunch and don't really want much for dinner.  I visit less often, but when I go, it is usually for dinner.  Obviously, she eats here a lot more often than I do.  

You walk in the restaurant and to the right is the bar area.  We tend to go straight into the restaurant.  Up front, are standard strip mall plate glass windows looking out on Clearview.  Further back, the glass is replaced by wall and you have more of the feeling of a sushi restaurant.  It does change the ambiance of the meal, where you sit.

On our last visit, we started off with an order of Edamame.  Then we shared orders of their Rocky II rolls and the Breezy rolls.  I wasn't too thrilled with their Rocky II rolls.  However, the Breezy rolls were something else.  It might not be to the taste of a true sushi gourmet due to the cream cheese in the roll, but I liked the combination of the snow crab, crawfish, and avocado mixed with the cream cheese.  The rolls were lightly fried and topped with tuna.

We had no complaints about the service which was quick and efficient.",1,"good"

After working out as a guest at Elmwood Fitness Center, one of my girlfriends and I were starving and ate here.  Since it was an amazing night we sat outside which was wonderful because we had the tables to ourselves.  And the hostess was super sweet after she tried to seat me at one table inside, then I asked to move to another table, then my girlfriend didn't see me so I sat outside and I moved again!  She took it all in stride.

So one of the specials was half bottle night so we picked a chardonnay and shared it.  It even had a screw top which made it convenient to bring it home.  Another awesome item on their menu is where you can order three different types of sushi for like $13 and it includes miso soup and a salad!  What?  So both of us got that deal. All I remembered was that I ordered the salmon avocado roll, a second one with salmon and I forgot the third roll. They were all tasty!

And I totally forgot the appetizer but it's a tender fish that was falling off the bone! Delish!

One thing my gf taught me was to use ponzu sauce instead of soy sauce with sushi and it's better flavor! Worked for me!

Happy Japanese food eating!",2,"good"
