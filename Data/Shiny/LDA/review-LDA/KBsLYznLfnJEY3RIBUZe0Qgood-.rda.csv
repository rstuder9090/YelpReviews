Yelp 25 % off ayce with yelp check in, score!!!!

The inside is so pretty and well decorated, and I love the location! It's so so so close to my condo, and traders Joe's where I shop.

So after mom and I went to traders we squeezed in during the last 30 minutes till close, and they were totally cool about it. I recognized the owner from the carson location in the back.

The rolls omg just that perfect thin layer to cover but not over shadow the seaweed and fish, stick and sweet and tangy (rice white vinegar and sugar, held together seamlessly on all the rolls.

Mom ordered the Fuji and said the raw fish was some of the freshest she has had anywhere local, including minatio and hinko. The shrimp inside had a lovely crunch with out being too oily.

I order three rolls and loved the presentation on all of them as well as the spicy level.

The cici with no salmon (they were totally cool about it too) had wicked hot white sauce on it spicier than sriracha, but I loved it!!! The scallops were super fresh and the other tangy sauce paired nicely with the ripe avocado and the cream cheese was a needed to balance out the spice level. 

The moon dog poppers had crunch jalape√±o with the seeds taken out so it was much less spicy than the other roll, paired well with spicy crab and a crispy tempura case, and cream cheese filled innards.

Then the two next rolls were sooooo artistically done both my mom and I were taken back. Plated on craved wood the sauce designs were truly magical as you can see in the pictures!!! 

The volcano had the delicately fried out side, and was pipping hot, with the soft eggy sweet tamago inside and huge sweet scallops on top with a spice sauce and sauce all around the plate to drag through. 

The samurai was prob my fav. The huge chunks of pecans were such a lovely bit of nutty texture, to the cream cheese and fluffy fried shrimp, topped with again huge chunky scallops and black sesame seeds with 2 creamy spice sauces. Then again plated like a a piece from a museum!!

I can't not wait to go back and try more of the unique rolls and see the art they dish up.",1,"good"

As much as I love the buffet in the Atlantis, a change of pace was in order!  So on my last work visit to Reno I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and plugged in 'sushi'.  Kei Sushi was literally less than 2 miles from my hotel...and with great ratings!  I figure, well...with my per diem maxing out at about $25 for dinner, why not!!?

Upon arriving at Kei Sushi, even for a weeknight it was fairly busy.  I managed to get a nice, quite table near the back of the restaurant.  Service was still great throughout though, my server was attentive and back to me often with refills of drinks as well as sushi!

The AYCE runs $24.95 for dinner and you get run of the entire menu!  And boy...did I take full advantage of that!  I stuffed my gills silly with plate after plate of gourmet Japanese!  Here's an entire rundown of everything I savored:

-Rooster Salmon - salmon topped with lemon, pickled jalapeno, and spicy krab
-Kei Tuna (torched) - seared tuna with special crystal mix, scallop sauce, sriracha, and teriyaki
-Salmon Lover - salmon, scallop sauce, pickled jalapeno, salmon skin, and green onion
-Fire Ball - tuna topped with spicy tuna, fried onions, and teriyaki
-Quail Egg Shooter (delicious!) - quail egg, ponzu, sriracha, sesame seeds, green onion, and tobiko
-Macho Macho (hand roll) - crystal shrimp, spicy krab, cream cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, cilantro, and sriracha
-Iris (hand roll) - tempura shrimp, asparagus, and green onion topped with avocado, lemon, cilantro, and spicy krab
-Spider - tempura soft shell crab, cucumber, carrots, red tobiko, and mild sauce
-Blossom (baked) - crystal shrimp, and cream cheese topped with salmon, house sauces, and panko
-Fuji Mountain (hand roll) - crystal shrimp, and spicy mayo topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and spicy krab
-Optimus - shrimp and krab egg roll, and pickled jalapeno topped with seared tuna, avocado, lemon, and marinated red onion

That was a TON of food for just me!!  The great thing about Kei Sushi is that if you want to try a particular creation but don't want an entire long roll, they will make it into an individual hand roll!  They do this for all their specialty rolls except the ones that are fried or baked.

But I wasn't done yet!  Kei Sushi does something I haven't seen before, dessert sushi rolls!  Yes!  I tried:

-OMG -  tamago, cream cheese, and pecans, deep fried with a mix of panko, almonds, cinnamon, and coconut - topped with honey & chocolate

OMG indeed!  Not only was the dessert roll different, it was tasty too!  Actually, everything I had was delicious!  The fish was fairly fresh, served at the right temperature, and good serving sizes.  The rice was cooked very well too, not soggy or over sticky.

Even after all that, I finished the night with a serving of green tea ice cream.  I couldn't help myself!  I really packed it all in, I was saving calories all day just to splurge on dinner!  Totally worth it!

Next time I'm back in town for work - Kei Sushi is on my list of good eats!",2,"good"
