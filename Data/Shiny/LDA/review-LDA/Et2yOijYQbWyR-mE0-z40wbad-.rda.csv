"2","Do you #love sushi? Is your favorite roll a California roll? Are you a huge fan of #chefsspecial rolls? If so you are either white or basic. And you would love this place.  Bear with me before you label me as stereotypical, racist, or surprisingly intelligent.

Initial impressions :
*restaurant is inside an office building.
*interior is huge, with high ceilings
*simple crew working inside, but none of them looked Japanese. What does a Japanese person look like, you ask? Well, Google ""samurai"" and ""anime"" and you will have your answer.
*smells like a restaurant, but ventilation is good enough for the smell to be aromatic and not linger.

The good:
-menu is big. Caters to most preferences. They have sushi as well as entrees.
-gyoza is done well. Soft but not burnt at the bottom.
-I love the decor here. Simple, modern, stylish. The lights look like cut bamboo with lights inside. Reminds me of alien scout drones tho.
-Thai beef salad is good.
-chicken thighs dish is bomb. The dish my friend got was a little undercooked. 
-the sushi. Ahhhh sushi. It's really good. I've had better, but the ingredients taste well put together and the rice is not too tough. 


The bad:
-the fried rice is too salty and soft for my taste. Others might like it, but I prefer mine not to stick together so much. Also needs more garlic flavor. 

My complaint about this place is too many special rolls. Sushi is not about putting sauce or a bunch of crazy ingredients together with fish and calling it sushi. Sushi is about simplicity, fish and rice. That's it. Japanese food is about capturing the essence of food in a simple manner, not bastardizing it with a bunch of ingredients. They've lost their soul to cater to the corporate and white crowd. For that, I weep.",1,"good"
"3","I went to Tsunami last night for my belated birthday dinner with some close friends and it exceeded my expectations. I was impressed by the ambiance, level of service we received and the food. I've been to the Tsunami in Baton Rouge many times and while the view there is spectacular, the food definitely falls short. I still wanted to try the Nola location after checking out the menu online and hearing about how trendy the restaurant was. Although this one doesn't have the rooftop view, it does have huge windows and a great view of the surrounding CBD area. We were greeted by really friendly hostesses upon walking in. The interior was gorgeous and would make for a really cute date night. Our server was awesome!! And very attentive - I think her name was Emmaline if I remember correctly. She informed us that Thursday was ""Ladies' Night"" and that one of their specialty cocktails was half off, so that was pretty cool. They have a very large selection on drinks including a sake flight that I want to return and try. I noticed that when some of our friends left the table momentarily, she refolded their linen napkins for them. I thought this was worth mentioning because I've only seen that level of service at fine dining restaurants and it was a super nice touch on her part. Anyway, moving on to the menu itmes. For dinner, our table shared several small plates. We ordered:

-Edamame hummus - surprisingly tasty
-Ika fries
-Oysters agemono
-Truffle salmon - nothing special, wouldn't order this one again
-Luscious lemonfish (my personal favorite)
-Sunflower (seared tuna in spicy ponzu, this was a table favorite)
-Sushi rolls: Transbestite, Lava, John Breaux, Munchie, and some other rolls I can't recall. The Transbestite was delicious!! It disappeared quickly. 
-Dessert: chocolate Tsunami cake with vanilla ice cream, complimentary birthday mochi, Vietnamese coffee ice cream. The Tsunami cake was really good but omg, the Vietnamese coffee ice cream was amazing!! And huge because six of us were able to share it and we still had a large scoop leftover. 

I'm happy we have another great addition to the CBD! Everyone in our group genuinely enjoyed dinner here. I can foresee it making a great lunch spot for businesses in the area as well.",2,"good"
"4","Went in for a friends birthday on a Tuesday night.  Made reservations for 10 people, wound up being about 16, and that's when the everything started going sideways.. 

It's a Tuesday night.  You'd think that 16 people walk in interested in a lot of booze and food would be appreciated and bring at least a ""B game""....well, you're wrong.  We spent about $300 or so just at the bar...but that didn't stop the manager coming up to my wife and start complaining that ""If we'd known, we would have done a minimum price contract....you should have let us know.""  Wait, can you not handle large groups?  And why is it OUR problem?  We actually did have reservations for 10 already, sorry it was a bit more.  And who signs a contract for dinner?  I have NEVER signed an agreement for dinner with a restaurant unless they are privately catering an event.  Her attitude was insulting and basically made it seem like we were putting her out.

Then when we were seated, they told us ""don't crowd the people sitting in the same section.""  Wait...it's an almost empty restaurant....we don't care where we sit and why are you assuming we're going to be jerks?  They didn't try to put any tables together, and the service still sucked even though they added an obligatory 20% gratuity.  We weren't demanding, but for the prices that they were charging I would think the waitress would know what seasonal beers are on tap and not have us wondering ""hey, did she forget about us?"" when she left halfway through taking drink orders at our (separate from the main table) table.

Food itself: so so.  The appetizer was good, but the actual sushi was mediocre.  The unagi nigiri was something like eel jerky, and the spicy tuna itself wasn't actually spicy...just jalapenos. 

We spent about $1000 overall.  Did we get our money's worth?  Absolutely not.  If you want sushi in the CBD...I'll have to say that you have to go somewhere else.

NOTE:  Emailed the owner/manager who basically said she was working that location that night and didn't recall you.  She tried to defend signing a contract to (paraphrase) that they have experienced servers on hand and the ""kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed.""  If that's what they consider a small kitchen, I'm stunned and don't know what to say and have to question their size standards.  That kitchen is open, and HUGE!!!!  

She also said that the ""spicy tuna doesn't have jalepenos"" which now kind of scares me...I tried the fish seperately and it was bland tuna, and the peppers were definitely providing the heat.

Now I'm wondering what they served me???  I really feel ripped off now.",1,"bad"
"5","I really wanted to like this place, y'all. I came with two girlfriends on an early evening after spending days looking through their menu in anticipation. On paper it looks great-tons of fun rolls with unique combos like kiwi and strawberry, steak, spicy crawfish, etc. Really though, none of it was good. 

I'll start with the location. It's tucked next to the intercontinental hotel downtown so parking is definitely tricky (we used an uber). I will say that the restaurant itself really beautiful. The decor and ambience inside are so classy. It's spacious and elegant and has a really cool vibe. I almost gave them three stars for the decoration and seating alone. 

So the food. A lot of the rolls are very pricey ($15-$18) which at first was a bit surprising but given the reputation and location I suppose that's around the norm? We ordered the rock n roll, the John breaux, California, spicy tuna, and a few other fun rolls. I was severely unimpressed. Not only was it dry and pretty tasteless, but it also did not taste fresh. Their spicy mayo was...I don't even know but I wouldn't call it spicy and it sort of was congealing at the tops-yikes. All of us at the table were underwhelmed and this is coming from three people who eat a LOT of sushi. One person even told us she wasn't feeling well that night after dinner. 

The service was just alright. We were never sure what mood our waitress would be in when she returned to the table-sometimes super happy and smiling and sometimes not making eye contact, sighing, and looking very unhappy with us...not sure what was going on there. Also, for only having 3 tables of customers, the food took more time to come than it should have.
