I used to frequent Mixx about 6 years ago, when the all you can eat was $20/pp. Then it was raised to $24 pp, and it just wasn't worth it anymore. All the reviews are right about them stuffing it with rice. I like the AYCE sushi places that allow you to grab one of everything (Minado) rather than a whole ROLL of something. That's why I stopped going. The rolls were stuffed with rice, and it just wasn't worth the $24+ tax anymore.

Last night was my first time back in YEARS. I only went because my other 8 friends wanted to go, so why not.

I still opted not to get the AYCE. I got the nori soup, Yamasai roll, spicy scallop roll and my bf got Roll Combo C for $15. Our whole bill including 18% tip and tax was $51 between the two of us AND we ended up taking almost 10+ pieces home with us.
- Nori soup: 3 stars. Standard, a little salty, but OK
- Yamasai roll: 4 stars - fish was relatively fresh - salmon, avocado and spicy tuna on top
- Spicy Scallop - 4 stars: very tasty :)
- Spicy yellowtail of Roll C: fresh, standard, good
- Tuna Avocado and Alaskan roll were also 3.5 to 4 stars- good standard sushi. I would compare the quality to Vic's in Rittenhouse
* They also put their wasabi in a cute flower form, I love that 
* Service was very friendly. We split out 10 table bill like.. 7 ways, and they didn't mind at all. BYOB is always a plus. For all these reasons they are a SOLID 4 stars

*****TIP*****
 My opinion is that you should only get the AYCE sushi $25pp if you can COMFORTABLY eat more than 24 pieces of sushi. Why? Their maki rolls (hand cut rolls) are very reasonably priced at $5 to $6 a roll. Each roll = 8 pieces. You can get the rolls individually anywhere from $15-$18 for 24 pieces of sushi (which is less than $25) OR you can get the ROLL COMBOs like my bf did for $15 which comes with salad or miso soup.
OR you can get the AYCE if you can comfortably eat 2 of the special rolls bc they are priced at $10-$13 a roll.

In my opinion, I left without feeling like I had to stuff my face on the verge of throwing up because they charge $1 for anything you don't finish eating. All my friends felt like puking, sleeping, dying afterwards. My bf and I enjoyed an amazing meal, with friendly service, with leftovers, OH and i forgot to mention our $51 dollar bill included mochi for dessert too! We will be back if we're in the area :)",1,"good"
"3","Visited tonight with my boyfriend and I we were both very pleased with the great service  and the sushi was good. But before I get into that, Interestingly enough I was surprised over the weekend to see the Yelp had listed Mixx being closed down and I had to see for myself If this was true. I had my suspicions. This  restaurant is not closed down and I don't know how or why that information was tagged on yelp. 

Anyway back to my experience. We both decided to get the  all you can eat sushi special for $25 a person. Considering each roll ranged from $8-15, it seemed worth it to get the deal,  The menu offered for the deal practically included everything on the regular menu, plus you could have lots of appetizers. Though in literal terms; There was a maximum item of 20 items per person, though I can't imagine how anyone could need more the 20 items of food. Also there is a fair warning that you will be charged $1 for every piece of  unfinished food, so if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, be prepared to pay. Gratuity is also included on the check.

Its BYOB and they gave our bottle of wine a nice, cozy, iced pail and good sized glasses.

Anyways, We started off with lots of appetizers, Fried Oysters, or Kaki Fry, Takoyaki.
Nori Soup, Aged tofu, Shumai and Bacon and Quail Egg Skewers. They all were really good, they came out nice and hot, maybe a little too hot. Small portions, but they all were very good and nicely presented. 

We each got a Sashimi Platter, though that was included in the all you can eat deal it was limited to 1 per person. However, it was very pretty and the sashimi was very pleasant and tasted fresh; don't ask me what kind of fish it was though, There was a  red and 2 white fleshed fish, 6 slices of fish in all.

Finally we got 3 specialty rolls. Dragon Roll, Ichiban, and Dallas, They were 8 pieces each and the put it on an awesome Japanese bridge shaped serving platter, it was so nice A bright blue lit glass decorated with rice noodles and a cherry flower on top, I'm sure I'm describing it crazy, but it was very pretty. In addition we had regular sushi  which were the Hokki clam, White tuna, and Smoked salmon. The regular sushi was 2pieces per order.  It was sooo much food. 

All in all a great experience, Pricey but we'll go back, and once again, It's Not closed.",2,"good"
"4","We stopped by last night for AYCE sushi. With the $2 extra tagged onto the sweet shrimp, tax and tip, our total was $64. 60-70 dollars is hardly too much to pay for sushi, much less AYCE, but our meal was not in the least worth it.

All the sushi pieces came with excessive amounts of rice. It's pretty clear they're trying to fill you up with the cheapest ingredient. The sweet shrimp was pathetically small, and we did not have the choice of getting our shrimp heads fried until crunchy or cooked in a miso broth as is usually done when we order sweet shrimp. Instead it was maybe blanched and tasted really fishy and old. 

They actually messed up the order and gave us uni instead the first time. This is not really understandable since there were about as many employees milling around as they had customers.

All the rolls that come with raw fish on top came with pathetically small and thin squares of raw fish. It was getting kind of ridiculous feeling like no matter what we ordered we were eating a lot of rice and panko.

The miso soup was okay, store bought, not too salty, featuring stingily diced tofu though. 

The sashimi platter was limited to one order per person and it consists of 6 pieces of not quite fresh fish that required a lot of soy sauce and wasabi to battle its stench.

The selection may seem extensive at first but it's all variations on the same theme. For a restaurant that bills itself as ""fusion"", it didn't really have any adventurous or innovative flavor combinations. 

I can see no good reason for us to ever return.",1,"bad"
"5","I'm not going to lie here. When I went to Mixx, I was extraordinarily hungover from the night before and with a party of sixteen people I had just met. However, I know myself pretty well, and Mixx would deserve two stars no matter what the conditions.

The group was late for the original 8:30 reservation. When we showed up at 9, the table had not been set yet. By the time sixteen people showed up and sat down, we were missing chairs, silverware and glasses of water from all ends of the table. Many of us never received water or napkins throughout the entire meal.

Some people chose the AYCE deal, but I just couldn't. The thought of raw fish was making me queasy (and you know I adore sushi). I went for a tofu teriyaki bento box. Tried to play it safe.

As the rolls around me started arriving, I noticed one thing: where's the fish? These rolls were mostly rice, and clumpy, mushy looking rice at that. What a rip. The spice tuna looked like raw ground beef. I almost heaved.

My bento box arrived with plenty of food. Soup, salad, rice, dumplings, tempura and tofu. The tempura and tofu were deep-fried so heavily I couldn't finish my meal. 

Take this review however you'd like. Sure, I was hungover as balls, but homegirl can eat no matter what the circumstance. I will not be returning to Mixx.",2,"bad"
