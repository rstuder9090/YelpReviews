"2","Usually had good experiences here anyway..but it has been a couple of years since I've been there, and after seeing some of these reviews i wasnt sure what to expect this time. 

Well a friend and i ordered the Boat with the sushi & sashimi yesterday. It was EXCELLENT!  Very fresh. Good size portions. Great variety. There were at least 4 pieces of each sashimi item and they were nicely cut. And beautifully plated, of course. The white tuna (my fave) was to die for! 

Friendly, attentive service. Granted they were not busy at that time of day, but we sat at the sushi bar and had a lovely conversation with people working there...and they do not breathe down your neck or really push anything extra.

Can't wait to go back again!",1,"good"
"3","We tried other Japanese hibachi style restaurants before, but nothing came as close to being ""perfect"" than this one.  Mind you, we live in Huntingdon Valley, PA which is about 50 miles from this restaurant and we have been to this restaurant for 5 times already since they opened in late 11/2012.  We'd go more often if it is closer to our house.

Food is excellent and the staff is very courteous with services.  Gotta try the ""sushi on a ""flaming"" torch...  Wow!!  They bring the sushi on a plate (wrapped in aluminum foil) on fire, demonstrating a really impressive presentation.  Perfect for a couple on  a date.  'wink, wink' 

Ample parking space as well as really upscale decor thru-out.   If you want to go, go during the weekday evening for little more quiet ambiance as Saturdays are  little more noisier from the weekend crowd.   Reserve your weekend trip there for friends and family for more lively audience and crowd, if you are into those sort of events...",2,"good"
