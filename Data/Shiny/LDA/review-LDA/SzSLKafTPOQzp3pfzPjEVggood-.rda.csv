"2","My roommate and I were literally laying in our beds bored and hungry and I mentioned sushi. Her face lit up and I automatically lit up seconds after seeing her light up -bottom line: we were lit for sushi. (Sorry for using young slang, we were just really pumped to grub on some sushi) so funny enough my roommate knows I use yelp for most things cause I like my food to be ~of quality~ and so she says ""do your yelp thing and let's eat some good sushi"" and I was like SAY NO MORE. So fast forward and I found that this place had good reviews (""best sushi in town"") AND it was like 3 mins away. The pictures of the sushi is what really got to me and trust me-the pictures you see are real because I experienced this sushi firsthand. It was beautiful. My roommate ordered the cowboy roll, two pieces of the salmon sushi and the chicken tempura dinner. Her chicken tempura dinner came with miso soup and a ginger salad-which came out quickly and both were yummy! She let me eat the whole salad and I thought it was bomb. We both had no complaints on the chicken which did come with fried vegetables which was all great. Moving on to the sushi-her cowboy rolls were delish!! You could tell they were fresh and just made. My roommate is a huge salmon fan (who isn't am I right?) and so she chose these rolls specifically for the salmon in them and we loved it. Her salmon sushi was also delicious. Moving on to what I ordered- from the beginning I wanted some good sushi and you bet your sushi-eating butt that that's what I got. I ordered the Volcano roll and I'm crying right now as I type this bc I'm having some post-sushi depression (I'm making that a thing now) the volcano roll absolutely quenched my thirst for sushi. It was delightful. The flavor just kinda bursts in your mouth and then there's a crunch (from the crab on top) and then before you know it you're just lying in a sushi coma. I seriously devoured this plate of sushi. And there were soooo many other rolls that I wanted to try but I thought I better save them for next time. There will definitely be a next time. Now since I haven't quite yet tried all the sushi Tampa has to offer- I won't say this is the best sushi in town BUT it got 5 stars from me. Give this place a try!! PS. My roommate and I didn't know this beforehand but on Mondays they give USF students 10% off their bill! Happy sushi eating :-)",1,"good"
"3","I had planned to try a highly-recommended Vietnamese restaurant in this same shopping center, but found they had closed early on the Saturday before Easter. Thankfully I remembered Ichiban was located nearby, and had an excellent sushi dinner instead.

Ichiban Japanese Cuisine & Sushi Bar is located in the University Collections shopping center at the intersection of Fowler Avenue and Bruce B. Downs Blvd - right near the USF campus. Even though this is a busy shopping center, the inside of the restaurant is calm and serene, with an emphasis on high quality sushi, sashimi and tempura. You'll find lots of tables and booths scattered around the restaurant, along with a traditional sushi bar and the very traditional izakaya-style of seating whereby the customers sit on tatami mats or specially-crafted seats, and dine from low tables.

Ichiban has a very nice mixture of fresh sushi and sashimi, and a wide variety of sushi / sashimi combination samplers, Bento boxes, and rice bowls. They also have a fantastic selection of rolls from the traditional California, Rainbow, and Tampa to the very exotic house special rolls found on the flip side of the menu.

My lovely date and I sat at the sushi bar and were warmly greeted by the sushi chefs with the traditional saying of ""Irasshaimase"", which is the proper Japanese way of welcoming a customer into their place of business. We responded back by saying ""Konbanwa"" or Good Evening, which raised a few smiles from the chefs. While we looked over the menu the chefs presented us with a small appetizer sample of cucumber salad in vinegar sauce. Clearly this gift was due to my amazing talent with the Japanese language.......and thankfully I did not need to embarrass myself further by mumbling my way through any other phrases. (Actually everyone who sits at the sushi bar is graced with this delicacy.)

We decided to share three different rolls for our dinner, and we felt that we made some excellent decisions. First was the S & J Roll which was spicy crab SP with tempura crunch flakes, avocado slices, rolled in nori and rice, and then topped with yellowtail (amberjack tuna). Our second roll was the Tobiko Special Roll which was made with yellowtail and scallions, rolled in nori and sushi rice, and then covered with three different types of flying fish roe (black, green, and red). This was a very colorful and delicious roll!  My personal favorite for the night was the Matt & Rosy Roll which was fresh salmon slices over a Volcano topping roll. This was clearly the salmon-lovers roll for the night! All of the food was very creative and very delicious.

They make an amazing-looking tuna martini which I want to go back and try on my next visit. Ichiban has specials on Monday nights for USF students, and I saw some terrific budget-friendly lunch specials as well.

Great little spot for those who enjoy good sushi. They menu also shows a nice mix of cooked dinner entrees -- teriyaki, grilled and broiled meats & seafood, and tempura.",2,"good"
