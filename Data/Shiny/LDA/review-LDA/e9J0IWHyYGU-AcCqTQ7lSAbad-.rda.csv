Kaisen, like 4 rivers, is surprisingly closer than I thought. It is in a strip mall with Michael's goods and a Nutrition s'mart just south of the Bearss/Dale Mabry intersection.

The decor is somewhat understated. It is clean and has a intimate feeling (on a weekday evening).I had 2 servers rotating but they were nice and prompt with food/drinks etc. Bonus points to the one who presented the omakase;she rattled off the entire list and description without error.
 You can tell it there are many regulars b/c one of the chefs is very gregarious, talking to the customers like long time friends.

I've been to sushi places in Tampa,St Maarten, Detroit, and Chicago. I fall straight in the middle of being the sushi experience graph.
I tend to be somewhat conservative and get 3 maki rolls, with 2 special and one simple.

However, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try the Omakase (chefs choice)at the 35 dollar level (I generally spend about 30 US give or take at sushi restaurants). 

I had 2 plates for the Omakase. The first was a mixture of cups filled with roe/other fish, sashimi, and nigiri. Usually Im pretty meticulous at remembering what I ate. The server told me everything in great deal but I couldnt remember it lol.
I posted a picture if you want to try and ID it . I liked the ""cups"" the best, very flavorful especially the roe and the 2nd/3rd cups from the left side.
The sashimi was the second best they were very melty in your mouth and yummy.
The nigiri was solid, but loses to the other two.

The second plate of omakase was an eel roll. This had a nice sauce (perhaps Ponzu?) and very flavorful.

I was still hungry , so I ordered the Okonimiyaki on a whim. Man this thing is huge!
I was expecting a dinky IHOP pancake. While seafood and pancake screams GI dysfunction, I found it an excellent combo. It was served piping hot and I inhaled the little that I could finish  
Note: It takes about 22-23 minutes minimum and is $11 but its worth it.

There are 2 schools of thought wiith sushi. Some prefer American style sushi with many sauces and lots of combinations of fish, and some some prefer a more Japanese style with minimal sauce and just 1-2 fish.
I cant say which is better;I like some of both.
The fish quality is very good all around. The omakase and okonimiyaki are new experiences for me. 

Kaisen is better than many Tampa restaurants, but not the absolute best I've ever had.

That honor goes to Toro Sushi in Chicago. (See my review. Blatant plug)

The prices were very fair regarding the rolls. IIRC, the most expensive roll is about 12, whereas other Tampa specialty roll tend to go into the 15-16 range.

I would come back to Kaisen though in the future. You should too.",1,"good"
"3","I've had lots of mediocre sushi in Tampa. From SB in Ybor City to CB near the stadium, there's a lot of just average... or restaurants trying too hard to be fusion.  I grew up near Tampa, and every time I come back, there's only one requirement as far as dining -- I have to get in to see Ryo at Kaisen Sushi.

Kaisen is a little known secret that Tampa has been hiding for years.  Ryo initially opened over by Harpos, further south on Dale Mabry than their current location.  I went in for the first time in 1999, and have been a repeat customer ever since, dining there sometimes twice a week.  In all my years of eating at Kaisen, I've never once been disappointed.  In fact, they know me by name now and I get that personal of service that keeps me coming back.

Here are my highlights:

Appetizer:
Calamari -- I can't say enough about this stuff.  It's not your typical frozen rings, this stuff is FRESH.  They saute large chunks octopus, not just rings or tentacles, in a delicious sauce that has a mild tangy flavor to it.  It's then topped with bonito flake, green onion, and a lemon.  I could eat calamari appetizers as a meal and walk away satisfied... 

Stuffed Mushrooms -- Forget everything you know about stuffed mushrooms.  Ryo takes large mushrooms, stuffs them with crab meat, tempura batters, and deep fries them.  They're then coated with what I think is ponzu sauce for a delicious creation. 

Nigiri:

One of my personal favorites is the zuke tuna.  Ryo takes the best cuts of Tuna and marinates them in what I believe to be sesame oil, rice vinegar, and soy sauce, for about three days.  The fish changes consistency and flavor, and becomes just ridiculously good.  You have to try it.

Ryo's fish selection and cuts are the absolute best in Tampa, in my opinion.  He hand-selects everything, and he's committed to culinary excellence.  You really can't go wrong.

Rolls:

My personal favorite, although not containing raw fish, is the Cynthia's Vegetable Tempura roll.  The kitchen takes asparagus and sweet potatoes, tempura batters, then deep fries them.  These scrumptious veggies are then rolled up and served with a side of ponzu sauce.  It's HEAVENLY. 

The spicy tuna is by far the best I've ever had as well.  Most restaurants pulverize the tuna or use shoddier quality of fish.  Ryo takes his sushi tuna, cubes it, and mixes it with spicy sauce.  You don't feel like you're eating some strange mush -- it has consistency, texture, and above all, great flavor.

Dessert:

I love the green tea ice cream.  It's that simple.  They also carry ""Red Bean"" ice cream, but I tend to stay away from that.  It's a little too weird for me. 

For all you non-sushi lovers, they do a delicious cooked salmon and chicken teriyaki.  

I can't recommend Kaisen Sushi enough, that's plain and simple.  If you're a first time sushi-er, or a seasoned expert, stop into Kaisen and prepare to be wowed.  They also organize a yearly fishing trip, and I hear a lot of people have had a really good time on these excursions.  You'll always see Ryo making sushi, and his Dad and sometimes his wife are there working to keep the place running smoothly.  

GO! NOW (unless it's Sunday or Monday)!  DO IT! :-)",2,"good"
"4","This rating is purely on the service.  I have no idea as to the quality of the food.

We came here on a Saturday evening and the place was fairly crowded.  After waiting a minute or so, we were greeted and told that the only seats were at the sushi bar.. fine.    We sat down at the bar and waited and waited and waited.   While sitting there we looked at the sushi roll menu in the plastic stand... my menu was dirty (disgusting).  It didn't seem like a good selection of rolls.  

Nobody came to give us a menu or ask if we wanted drinks.    So we ended up asking the sushi chef and he had to ask one of the girls.    She finally come over with a menu and asked if we wanted drinks... a coke and iced green tea.    Drinks never came and we noticed that our 'waitress' was roaming around the dining area but still did not have our drinks.    

After waiting a few more minutes, we decided to leave and walk out.    Thankfully, we found Sushi Alive down the road.",1,"bad"
"5","The best way I could describe this place is a little coarse or crass. From their choice of miso paste which was very coarse instead of the usual smooth paste to the almost crunchy quality of their wasabi, very course and crispy and devoid of taste or heat. I enjoy the upgrade of the space and the youthfulness of the staff, but I feel these changes have lead to a distinct loss of refinement one usually expects at a sushi restaurant. The waiter was a bit crass, I was taken aback by his stance and conversation style he didn't really want to explain too much. Even with his handling of other customers, he wasn't backing down on his correct naming of dishes, the table near us tried to order Unagidon or eel and rice bowl and he kept correcting them, ""you mean Chirashi don"" which sadly was incorrect. I ordered the Omakase to get a feel of the chef and menu, and as each plate came out there was no description, no explanation. I would have welcomed some sort of explanation at least so that I could order the same dish again if I came back, but I may not. The menu looks playful and so too do the platings but they lack substance to shoulder their beauty. I'd love photographing this food, but I'd rather hit up the sushi bar up the street. It's the youthful invigoration I feel that takes the taste a little lightly, even the soy sauce at the table lacks body and taste. I'm happy to have tried the place so I can mark it off as a place I can avoid.",2,"bad"
