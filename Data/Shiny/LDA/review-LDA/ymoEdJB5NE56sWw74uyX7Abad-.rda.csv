"2","We tried Sushi Bar last night when our usual place had a (temporary, I hope) problem with an unappetizing odor. So glad we made that decision--this place was excellent.

Saturday night around 8 PM and we got a table no problem, although the restaurant was busy. Got a great two-top in front of the window that was perfect for conversation with The Huz.

Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful. I asked her for her top three favorites and she asked a few follow-up questions (raw or cooked? cold or hot? fried or baked?, spicy or not?), then gave us suggestions for a variety of choices.

We decided to skip the special roll with the jalapeño on it (I can't remember the name, might be Jalapeño Roll) because she said it was very spicy and that's not my thing, then Huz said I could make all the choices because he always likes what I pick. I like to spread our choices out between hot & cold plus a variety of fishes:
-- Spicy Girl ($10.99) has ""sword fish, white fish, crab meat, pineapple with green spicy sauce on top"". The sauce didn't look green but it did have a kick and a little sourness to it as well. The bits of pineapple were a nice surprise in the bite & not overdone. The waitress recommended this one for someone who likes the level of heat to not exceed that of spicy mayo (e.g., me).
-- Tokyo Roll ($10.99) has ""spicy salmon, baked salmon with spicy mayo on top"". The roll was topped with crunchy bits, too. It was a creamy, salmon-y taste that was very good. May have been Huz's favorite, which makes me smile because it was the only one I chose that the waitress didn't specifically recommend.
-- Dynamite ($9.99) has ""spicy shrimp, eel, avocado, crab meat, salmon"" and is deep fried. There was spicy mayo and (I think) eel sauce on top, too. It is a wide roll but the slices are thin enough that one bite will do it. I loved all the different flavors in this one and saved this for my last bite because it was my favorite.
-- Statue of Liberty ($15.99) has ""crab meat, avocado, mango, baked lobster, scallop with spicy mayo on top"". This one was baked & piled high with stuff, although the slices themselves weren't very big. I didn't taste the mango. It was good but not our favorite and, as the most expensive roll, had the ""lowest flavor to price ratio"" according to Huz.

The waitress told us that the baked roll would take longer so when we ordered we asked for the rolls ready earlier to come out first, which the lady who took our paper said was a good idea. We got some edamame to eat while we waited and all of our rolls came out together 15-20 minutes after we were done with the edamame. I didn't mind at all because we were having such an enjoyable time together. As a matter of fact, I thought it was great since the restaurant was so busy and we've had horrible experiences with waiting too long for sushi at Tegry Bistro. I liked having all of the rolls at once because I like to compare the flavors.

Huz drank two Kirins on special for $2 apiece, although I see in other reviews that the special price might be the regular price. That sits just fine with him.

We would go back to Sushi Bar in a heartbeat. Everything was delicious and service was outstanding. Oh, and I loved saving $5 using Coupons4Indy.com.",1,"good"
"3","This place is absolutely, positively incredible.

For starters, the sushi is as good as you'll find for three times the price at a trend-setting Chicago or downtown Indy sushi restaurant, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, and intimate. (When Mrs. Quest and I had dinner there a few weekends ago, I ""overheard"" every single catty remark the verbose young gentleman at the table next to ours made about all three of his closest friends. That was a bit of dinner entertainment.)

Then there's the bottled beer menu. Basically, it works like this: all domestic bottles are $1.00. That's right, $1.00. 

But what if the thought of drinking a Miller Lite with dinner gives you hives? What if you just can't eat sushi without sipping one of those giant silver cans of Sapporo? They've got you covered. (But it'll set you back $2.00 instead of just $1.00.)

Awesome place to eat your fill of delicious rolls or just sit around and get tanked on suspiciously--probably illegally-cheap--beer.",2,"good"
"4","I ordered for delivery after a rough day at work, thinking I'd treat myself to something tasty! I ordered two rolls, the 2009 and the spider wig, along with an order of crab rangoon and an order of beef yaki udon (never tried anywhere before!). First thing that was irritating was they forgot the sweet and sour sauce for the crab rangoon--may seem trivial to some but I am a dipper! It makes a huge difference to me! I still tried to eat them even without the sauce, but they are taken over by onion. I meant to take a picture but I forgot, there were quite a few visible onions. At first I thought maybe I was just seeing the crab in a weird lighting but no--definitely onions. But okay--they were edible I suppose but I wouldn't order them again. I bought the beef yaki udon mostly for my husband but had to have a few bites since I've never had it before. I could have lived without. The beef, however, was delicious in it! But the overall flavor was lacking. Now here's where I got really irritated (partially ignorance on my part) but the spider wig roll features ""soft shell crab, avocado, topped with spicy tuna and pineapple""; sounds delicious, right?!  Well, a few pieces in, I started getting this weird crunch--not a tasty crunch, more like it didn't belong crunch. So I investigated. It's a shell-on soft shell crab! Like I said--ignorance on my part but I feel like that could be in their description. Okay--last annoyance--they didn't devein the shrimp for the shrimp tempura...sure, some people don't mind but if I'm paying the amount of money I paid, the least the can do is clean the shrimp properly. If they aren't cleaning the shrimp, it makes me wonder what other short cuts they're taking and with seafood, I definitely don't want to find out their poor practices the hard way!",1,"bad"
"5","DO NOT GO HERE!!! The only redeeming thing about this restaurant was our waitress, Cindy. She tried her best to help, but despite her best efforts, we were left stunned and in disbelief at how horrible the management treated both the patrons and the wait staff. The management should be ashamed for not coming to our table to defend their decision not to take off a meal which was served at least 45 minutes after two others in our party received their meals. The worst part is the meal was not worth waiting for! It was total CHAOS! Some sushi arrived while others were forgotten. There were only four people in our party, and while waiting for sushi isn't something unusual, we have never had meals arrive in bits and pieces over a 45 minute time period! 

Two other parties near us had similar problems and the kitchen was blamed every time. Interestingly, one party next to us walked out and cancelled a meal that was forgotten.There were so many mix-ups and excuses and apparently many apologies that went out tonight, but little to make customers want to return. 

The worst part of this experience was that it cost us a lot of money! We work hard for our money but apparently the owner of this sushi bar does not recognize this. If you ignore this review and try it anyhow, just remember not to blame Cindy - she's a sweet gal who should not be cheated out of tips just because the management cowers in a corner and refuses to talk to its customers.

People who came in after us and ordered after us had their food and finished eating before we even got all of our food. It was two hours of waiting with less than satisfying results.

One more thing. This place looks cool on the outside, but what should matter is good, fresh food and great customer service. This had neither! Dressing-soaked salad, barely warm miso soup, warm and dried up tuna on the nigiri and Panko  shrimp instead of tempura shrimp all lead me to say ""yuck"" and wonder if this place will one day give someone food poisoning.",2,"bad"
