A single word of unknown French origin. Much like the food, usually also of unknown origin. 

But we alllll go. You die hard foodie snobs out there, admit it. We all go, we all secretly love it and we all shrink at the notion that...GASP...we may actually enjoy them. We walk in like puffed up angry little birdies ready to shred them in our yelp reviews, riddled with low expectations and a keyboard trigger finger. SEEK AND DESTROY. 

I've figured out a trick to Buffet dining. NO expectations.

Which is probably why I liked Noburu so much. 

Now, there's a trick to Buffet dining that some folks just don't get. Go...when they open. For Noboru, 5pm is the golden hour. It's not quite busy yet, everyone's happy to see you, and the Chef's are just laying out the wall of sushi. 

If I were to compare Noboru to your average Center City shi shi sushi joint, of course it'd fail. However, comparing it to literally every single other sushi/mixed asian buffet I've ever been to (which is a lot, I'm quite fat.) It's the best. 

Is it pricey? Yes. I want my sushi to be expensive. Good sushi is expensive. You may pay 25 bucks a head for dinner, but you'll easily chow down 40 bucks worth of food.  

The service both times I went was exceptional. Very nice waiters, very attentive. Drinks always full. plates always removed. It's also incredibly clean. 

The sushi bar is their main feature, and I've tried all of it. 90% of it is good. The cooked food is your average Asian buffet fair with less grease, and a bit more flavor. They also have a rather wonderful little salad station. (Try the squid and edamame. YUM.)

They offer ice cream and plain tart yogurt for dessert with finger cakes and tiny little cookies. Cute cookies. Come on!

They also have dishes of the day. With our Sushi, we ordered the new york strip steak which..in all honesty...was pretty crap. BUT. Everything else was great. 

My point is, enjoy places like this for what they are, and don't condemn them for what they're not. If you walk in expecting a run of the mill buffet, you'll be surprised and you will enjoy yourself. 

If you walk in like you're Wolfgang Puck at a Golden Corral, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1,"good"
"3","Before I even get to the sushi, let me say they have Soon Du Bu (Korean Tofu Soup) and Hwe Dup Bap, two of my all time favorite asian dishes. I have never seen these at a buffet before, and I have to say it's like going to a bar and Springsteen just happens to be playing an impromptu set that night. 

Previous reviews didn't let me picture this place before I went, so I'll let you know that it is a newer constructed restaurant with high ceilings and a spacious feel. It is clean, clean, clean.

I knew to ask about the Soon Du Bu, so as soon as I was shown to my table I asked the server about it. She showed me where the soups were. There are several in cast iron pots ready to be heated. My server said she would bring it to my table when it was prepared.  

In the meantime, I grabbed a plate and filled it with one piece of each roll that intrigued me. This method usually yields a 15% YUM!, 50% pretty good, 30% meh, and 5% nah ratio at any given sushi buffet for me. On the day I went (Tuesday @ lunchtime around 12:30) the sushi was 25%YUM!, 65% pretty good and 10%meh. This could have been helped by the fact that the ginger, wasabi and soy sauce were better than what I've usually found at a sushi buffet. 

My the time I returned to my table with my first round of sushi, the soup was there. The service was terrific. The Soon Du Bu was just OK (Jong Ka Jib Soft Tofu Restaurant is still the very best) and the Hwe Dup Bap was great. Just remember to put the ""Korean Chili sauce"" and some rice on it then mix it up.

In summation, let me say that this place is just about perfect for what it is: an Asian buffet with a strong emphasis on sushi. You could eat just the sushi, but you'd be missing out on the other good dishes here.  I preferred Noboru over my last few visits to Minado. If you're looking for pure quality, there is no substitute for places like Bluefin. But if you're in the mood for a big meal with a lot of variety come here.",2,"good"
