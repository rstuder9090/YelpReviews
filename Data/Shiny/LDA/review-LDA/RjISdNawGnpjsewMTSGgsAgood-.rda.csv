"2","Before Kasumi came along, ""fresh fish"" and ""sushi"" in South Philly are not terms that go together. Even so, I happened to be in the area and ya know, when ya gotta craving it has gotta be satisfied! Turned on google maps and looked for a sushi place. Always knew this strip was the brand spanking shiny addition to the area but did not realize it contained this hidden gem. Was only expecting mediocre gas station food and mentally prepped myself to get sick but when I opened my little boxes of food, I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness and quality.
First up came the sashimi sampler. Again, was expecting just thin slices of fish(South Philly remember?) but it came with 5 robust pieces of sushi. And all the fish were fresh! 5 pieces is just enough to wet the palette.  
Next was the main attraction-the spider roll- it was nice and filling, had the satisfying taste of a fried soft shell crab and the sweet umami glaze.",1,"good"
"3","We're happy to welcome a new sushi spot to South Philly. Not only is it delicious and a lovely addition to this section of the city, there's a parking lot! Woo hoo! 

This spot is way down deep in South Philly. It actually makes a great quicker option before or after an event at the stadiums or a trip to FDR Park nearby. 

The hospitality was fantastic and the food was ready quite promptly. 

Kiddos loved simple avocado rolls (no peanuts here for allergy reasons) and basic California and veggie roll options. They also really appreciated the Shirley Temples and were tempted by the Japanese sodas, which included melon and lychee flavors! 

The Champion roll done naruto style (cucumber wrap) was fresh and well loved, as was the spicy tempura rock shrimp, which were huge pieces, not bits. 

We enjoyed our FREE edamame with Yelp check-in. Spring rolls are the other option for the complimentary treat. 

Prices were fair and we loved seeing ramen, as well as fried rice, tempura and noodle dishes with your choice of seafood, salmon, veggies or meats. 

We'll definitely be back!
