"2","Its located conveniently just off Route 295 on Route 73. Owners are from South East Asia and hence the name of the restaurant. 

They serve mainly two types of food:
i) Sushi
ii) Singaporen-Malaysian

I've been there twice in 3 weeks and I must say that its one of the best sushi places in this area. Sushi is fresh and good. Prices are competitive ($17 for 15 pieces of sashimi). The tuna carpaccio is very nice. Most of the patrons tend to gravitate towards the sushi menu. I think its probably due to the fact that the people around here are not familiar with Malaysian/Singapore cuisine yet and hence it will take time for that to change.

As for the Singaporean/Malaysian dishes - I've only had the opportunity to try one basic dish (was too full to eat when I arrived there). The menu does boast some of the well known Malaysian/Singaporean dishes (curries, roti canai, satay, curry puffs etc..). I'll definitely will have to give those a try as the nearest 'Malaysian' restaurant is in downtown Philly.

As for the chef/owners - they're very accomodating and nice. Always giving out free appetizers for people who wait for take out orders (or even to the regulars there). 

I personally think that given time and some publicity, this place will definitely do well and will be bustling with more patrons (they are still a relatively new restaurant).

Update 8/29/07:
Ok I just came back tonight after giving the Malaysian/Singaporean dishes a try (needed a break from sushi). I'm upgrading the the Rating to 5 stars. I had:
1) Chicken Satay - Its really good - and they use chicken thighs (the right way to make good satay). I'll be trying the beef satay the next time
2) Chicken Rendang (dry chicken curry) - Felt like eating @ home in Malaysia. 

I must say that since I'll be coming here to NJ for the next few months for work, I'll definitely be spending at one night a week at this place as its just located near my hotel as there are so quite a few dishes to try.",1,"good"
"3","Just moved down here a few weeks ago, came from the metro NYC area and trying to scope out a new favorite sushi place. I've been spoiled up north, and frequent quality sushi is a requirement for my overall happiness and well being, so I was quite apprehensive at the start.

We stopped in today (Friday) around 12:30 for a quick lunch. We were greeted immediately and sat by a friendly woman who turned out to be our server as well. The place (small, 6 or 7 tables) was completely empty, and only two other parties came in the entire time we were there. This was lovely, as we could hear the jazz music playing in the background and service was quick and attentive. 

The menu is relatively small compared to what I'm used to, however there was still plenty to choose from and the maki lunch specials are a great deal. Onto the taste test-what a pleasant surprise! The shumai was rich in flavor and the accompanying sauce was slightly sweeter than what I am used to. Typically I wouldn't like this, but it was delicious. The sushi was very fresh and the proper temperature-not warm, but not cold enough to suggest it had spent the day sitting on a block of ice. Rice was the perfect texture as well. We had salmon, regular tuna, spicy tuna, and crab. All were great! 

While I have technically had better sushi in my life and I still have some exploring to do in the neighborhood, I can definitely say that I will be back and this place has a clear shot at becoming my favorite regular sushi spot. Definitely give it a try!",2,"good"
"4","This is a pleasant small restaurant in a typical NJ strip mall. We went there for lunch, attracted by the name and memories of noodles in the outdoors in Singapore. Seems that lunch here is primarily sushi, good sushi, but not much else. 

We didn't get the little salads other reviewers have mentioned or any sort of amuse bouche. In fact service was a pretty slow and inattentive. The spicy lemon grass soup was OK. As mentioned above the sushi was good and fresh. My noodles, well I guess I'll have to keep on hanging on to those memories of Singapore.... they were served as kind of a bento box . A small serving of noodles, a salad, a green kind of cardboardy Asian pirogi, a bit of avocado roll and some orange wedges.... OK but not what I was expecting. 

This disappointment coupled with the relatively limited non sushi lunch menu will definitely limit the number of times I go here.",1,"bad"
"5","It's rare that I come across a place whose reviews are so diametrically opposed to what I've experienced, so I'll try to be as detailed as possible 
in justifying my review.

I ordered the chirashizushi, which in Japan is almost a comfort food - fast and easy to make. Not something that would cost you $20. Maybe $10 for a really good bowl. Here's what went wrong...

#1: The sunomono appetizer was made with strong vinegar - like a Heinz maybe - instead of a lighter rice vinegar. Way too strong and sour. I guess it's okay that the cucumber was not the Japanese gherkin-like ones, but it should have been cut slightly thicker to retain crispness.

#2: When I order green tea, I expect at least Ito-En quality loose sencha, not genmaicha. This is a minor red flag when a place that serves Japanese food can't even get it's tea right.

#3: Chirashizushi is served in a bowl, with the sashimi and garnishes on top. This is so that the warm rice (not hot, not cold) stays warm longer. The rice was stone cold on a flat plate, and was of a medium quality - the quality would have been forgivable, but cold rice is just wrong.

#4: Sashimi slices were cut very stingily - about 1/3 as thick as they should have been. It was prettily arranged over the rice, but still amazingly stingy.

#5: The sashimi was a standard selection of 4 fish and shrimp. Some of the fish looked old and slightly dry - *not* a good sign at a sashimi place.

#6: I felt sick to my stomach not 5 minutes after leaving, so instead of relaxing at the coffee shop I had to rush home in case I lost it.

I suppose it's my fault for going to a Singapore restaurant for Japanese food. Who *does* that? Sadly, my first choice - Ta-Ke - had apparently shut its doors for good and I had to make a last minute choice.

Other things that made the experience feel stingy and unauthentic: Tea was served in a really large mug with a handle. Chopsticks were the reusable wooden variety instead of disposable, and badly chipped. Ick. Waitress didn't once come back to inquire about my needs or offer more tea, even though I was only one of two customers at the time.
Admittedly, their other dishes might be better - so please only consider this a review of their sashimi/sushi. Still, I can't say I'd give them a second try. Sorry.",2,"bad"
