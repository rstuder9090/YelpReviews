"2","I have been going to Yama since the year they opened. The sushi is fresh and tastes unique compared to your run-of-the mill sushi places. The roll pieces are bigger than most sushi places also so you get fuller off of less rolls. So I think the $ to $$ range is appropriate. The $ range of other sushi restaurants is usually small rolls that have a ""buffet"" sushi quality. The staff is always friendly and I have never had a bad service experience. Over the years they have developed many fusion type rolls and are always willing to grow. They have been ranked ""Best of Burlington County"" for the past few years for a reason. The only thing I wish they would do/could do is renovate the old diner car it used to be. If I won the lottery I would definitely give them money to do that because I hope this place stays around for years to come. I drive 25 minutes one way to get there for a reason, and I have 18 other sushi places closer to me. Some people may look from the outside and think ""who goes there?"" and the answer is a lot of people!!! It is very clean and they operate to high standards. The lunch buffet during a weekday is a great way to be introduced to the restaurant. The other menu items are true authentic Japanese Cuisine that is very hard to find in the United States. Sorry Chinese food people but you won't find a ""happy family"" or ""kung pow chicken"" selection on the menu, but a bento dinner box option is a great sampler of the food. Bottom line is- ""give em a shot"" and if you like them, please give a glowing review.",1,"good"
"3","My husband and I love this place. We go there whenever we what great service and delicious sushi. The chef there is pretty great and will make pretty much anything you want to order. We always get the Godzilla roll. I don't think we've ever ordered anything other than sushi. It is always so fresh and Yum. The only bit of advice I have for this place is that I wish that the ambience was a little better at night for romantic dinner. It is definitely our go to place if you want good food and BYOB but I just wish it had a little more of a vibe at night. Sometimes it feels like you're in a shopping market. If you're thinking about the chefs special roles just splurge get the more expensive ones they're absolutely amazing.",2,"good"
