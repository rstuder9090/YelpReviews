"2","The waitress had great timing. She was very nice. The food was exceptional and comparable in prices. Restaurant is clean. IThai  has sushi rolls. Everything we ate was delicious. We ate shrimp tempura that came with fresh, seasonal tempura vegetables. and it was lightly breaded and crunchy, typical soy sauce. The dumplings were the size of a small meatball served in a steamer basket with a sweet teriyaki sauce. Pork fried rice had large chunks of pork and scrambled eggs, a meal in itself. The crab Rangoon was crispy shell with the creamiest filling. It tasted like the crab roe which was soooo good. Miso soup was good and everything was placed on a bed of lettuce. The satay was tender and the peanut sauce was also creamy (Not gritty like some restaurants)! The menu was filled with different types of curry dishes, pho, and sushi. Visit this family owned business on Seminole blvd! You won't be sorry!",1,"good"
"3","IThai Sushi is an excellent local Thai restaurant in an unassuming location.

You don't really know what to expect judging by the outside. Inside, it's a cute little spot, a traditional Thai decor with tables in the center and booths around the sides in two rooms.

On a recent Monday night there were only 2 other couples dining, but the take out business was booming. That's always an encouraging sign. It's an extensive menu with all of the traditional Thai dishes, plus a wide variety of sushi. 

Amy tried the pad thai with chicken. This was excellent, among the best we've had. The noodles were cooked slightly al dente, the peanut sauce sweet and creamy, the garnishes of scallion and bean sprouts crisp and fresh. A generous portion of sliced broiled chicken topped the dish. This was ordered medium hot, and the spice is what you would expect - resulting in a runny nose and rosy cheeks but tasty in every bite.

I had the green curry with shrimp.  The curry was smooth and creamy with just a little heat, brimming with red and yellow bell pepper slices and at least 10 nice sized shrimp.  The shrimp were well prepared, a nice snap to each bite, firm and not mealy.  A generous scoop of perfect sticky rice (molded into the shape of a star, a nice touch) is served on the side.  The curry over that rice is to die for!

The tab for two was $30 including 2 soft drinks, so inexpensive.  If you're looking for excellent Thai food in a comfortable environment right here in town, try IThai. Recommended.",2,"good"
"4","I am a driver for a third party food delivery service. This restaurant marked the food as ready for pickup but still had me wait 35 minutes (yes, that is thirty five minutes after they marked it as READY FOR PICKUP). This is completely unacceptable and I will never deliver food from this restaurant again nor personally go to Ithai. I certainly will never recommend them as this is awful service to their customers. I have notified the third party food service that they should remove this restaurant from their list. This greatly impacts my job as well as other delivery drivers jobs. They are absolutely doing a disservice to their customers.",1,"bad"
"5","I don't recommend this place. There are plenty of decent Thai places in Pinellas county. This is the worst Thai food I believe I've had in my life.

HOWEVER, service is 5 Stars. They really do try to give you the red carpet treatment and make sure you are happy at this establishment. The women serving us were absolute dolls. And the rice in the shape of a heart was a nice touch.

It's unfortunate that the food falls so short. All items were edible but subpar in expectation and flavor. All of the food just feel like it needs to level up.

Food we ordered: Red curry with chicken, pad Thai, Thai iced tea, warm sake, spider roll, Tampa bay roll and Tom Kha Gai
All were bland. To be honest, I've had better sushi at Publix. 

Prices were ok. A little more than some places.

Ambiance - none. Very run down.

I drove out here on the request of my friend and won't be returning. Only having one other table at 7pm on a Saturday I guess could have been an obvious red flag.

I truly hope this little restaurant can find their niche and flavor",2,"bad"
