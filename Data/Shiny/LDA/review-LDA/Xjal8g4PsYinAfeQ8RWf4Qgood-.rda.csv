"2","Upon entering the small and quaint Japanese restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the host who brought us to our table.

We started off our orders with chicken fried rice for the children, and for the adults, the following: sushi boat, Longwood Garden roll, sashimi salad, spicy salmon roll, eel roll, followed by three orders of fried ice cream. We had a long stroll in Longwood Garden prior to this visit, don't judge.

Let me start off by saying the salmon was incredibly buttery and creamy. There was not one gristle that could be found in that massive chunk of salmon. The octopus was deliciously juicy and chewy with a wonderful sweet fragrance that explodes with every bite. The Longwood Garden roll was a perfect marriage of sweet and savory and the creamy avocado and salmon balanced the sweetness perfectly. The spicy salmon roll was not the typical wimpy slap blah of salmon mush slapped on top of the rice, this was real diced chunks of salmon carefully mixed with tangy mayo and a generous squirt of spicy sauce. There were more sushi we had, but I'm salivating as I wrote this and have to stop. 

I was so impressed with the sushi that I decided to try the kids chicken fried rice, curious on what impressive feat they can conjure up. The rice had the perfect balance of egginess and savoriness and blended in perfectly with the white chicken breasts that were generously salted. Delicious. 

Lastly, we finished our perfect day with a heaping scoop of fried ice cream. The batter was thick without being too heavy, it had a wonderful spongey texture that soaked up the left over ice cream that had melted into the bowl. The ice cream itself was cream, but the batter was the star here. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place for quality sushi and sashimi. The fried ice cream is also a decadent dessert that cannot be missed.",1,"good"

The owner of the restaurant, along with our waiter were both extremely attentive and engaging, but not over bearing. Our waiter was very good at offering some sushi suggestions while we were looking over the menu. My partner was very excited to see that they offered Sea Urchin Uni on their menu but was told that it is only available on Friday's and Saturday's. We sampled the seaweed salad and spicy tuna tar tar as appetizers and were absolutely blown away by both. The seaweed salad was served on a bed of julienned cucumber and was some of the freshest we ever tasted. The tuna tar tar was at first glance not what we expected. It resembled a spicy tuna filling with avocado on top, but again were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. For our sushi entrees we ordered a classic Rainbow Roll and a Fancy Lobster Roll. The Rainbow Roll practically melted in your mouth and had some of the freshest fish I have ever tasted. The Lobster Roll was absolutely out of this world and the creamy lobster meat was superb. To finish off our meal we had the Japanese Mochi Ice Cream in a tangerine/orange flavor. Being that neither one of us had ever had it we were both excited to give it a try and again we were blown away. The ice cream was rich and creamy and the rice paper that it was wrapped in also had a strong, but fresh orange flavor. It was the perfect ending to a delicious lunch. The  prices are very reasonable for both the sushi and Chinese offerings. I think Wasabi2 is quickly working it's way to being ""the place"" for sushi and Chinese food. If you are in or around the West Chester area this is definitely a place to visit.",2,"good"
