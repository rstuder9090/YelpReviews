"2","I am a little confused with the reviews. As 'the best sushi place in CWE', isn't the sushi supposed to be the best? 

It should be first emphasized that 'sushi' here refers to the traditional sushi as opposed to the rolls which in no way reflect the sushi quality and authenticity, conceding the fact that these rolls somehow resemble Makizushi. 

Sushi: 2/5, disappointment. Our assessment started from the Nigirizushi (hand-pressed sushi). Apparently it was not well pressed. When I tried to pickup the first sushi, it fell apart. I was also stunned by the sushi preparers' lack in fundamental knowledge such as condiments for different seafood (Amaebi is supposed to be served with grated ginger; grated ginger and sliced scallions accompany mackerel; scallop works better with sea salt and citrus, etc.) None of these happened. 

Ama Ebi (4/5): Botan shrimp took place in their amaebi sushi for its redundancy than the original Alaskan amaebi. As expected, it had less concentrated sweetness and weaker sweet aftertaste. On the plus side, the complimentary deeply fried shrimp head was crispy and the shrimp brain was a delicacy. 

Hotate (2/5): Scallops were lower in glycogen and thus sweetness less perceivable and also somehow losing the fresh texture. One hotate sushi was a failure because the sushi preparer broke the flat cylindrical muscle in half when it was butterflied. Poor preparation due to negligence. 

Saba(5/5): Very rich in omega-3 oil healthy fish, my personal favorite. Their mackerel was rightly cured and still preserved aromas of the mackerel and left it with less fishy oil. Nice job! 

Chirashizushi and Tekkadon 3/5: Very few pieces of small cuts of Sashimi in a huge bowl. I expected to see fish cut into a block shape about 1 to 1.5 inches thick, 3.5 wide. Here it was thin-sliced to translucent pieces. Chirashi often varies regionally but at least 2 slices of salmon and tuna are the baseline. I saw only one piece of salmon. Although tuna are usually thinner, the Tekkadon tuna here was so sheer, light and transparent like diaphanous films. The quality was not bad but they are overpriced. 
-----------------
Appetizer 4/5: We had Grilled Squid and Tempura. The tempura dipping sauce was great. The grilled squid was a bit overcooked and chewy but the sweet Teriyaky sauce with sesame was a delightful surprise.

Ambiance 5/5:  It is a very well decorated neat little place. A lovely restaurant. Quite and stress free. They even have one washitsu, a Japanese-style room having tatami flooring and other traditional architectural features. We were glad to see otoro on the menu, superior quality tuna highly perishable, and uni. 

Service 3/5: We ordered two Saba Nigiri but only got one. We had the second one after we asked the hostess to double check the order. Later she forgot to include a pen in our bill. 

As a medium to upper scale restaurant with the price to back it up, this establishment could train their employees to be more professional and staff more mindful of their guests. No amount of interior design or upholstery can make up for mediocre sushi.",1,"good"
"3","God I love this place. I'm writing an update for a few reasons. The first is that I recently tried their tofu Nigiri, and it is as good as everything I've ever tried from there. It's not how you would expect tofu to be, which I feel is worth mentioning. It's not a big hunk of curd, but rather is more like a flat square strip of tofu that they wrap around a chunk of rice, and they must marinate it in something delicious because it comes out tasting sweet and scrumptious. 

Another reason for me writing this update (and perhaps the most pressing) is that I tried Kampai for lunch one day within the past month, and I was VERY happy with my experience. It was the day after a big snow, but I had promised someone sushi lunch, so I had to deliver on that promise. We were the only people in the place, and the server (who is one of my favorites) commented on our loyalty, which made me smile. 

She also brought my guest and I a special complimentary appetizer, which was delicious. It was a lightly fried rectangle of tofu in a delightfully sweet teriyaki sauce with a slice of avocado on top. It was delicious, and I found it amusing as well that we go here so often that our server knew that at least one of us is a vegetarian. I also wanted to say that I don't know if she gave us a free appetizer because we are such loyal (and regular) customers, or because we were the only people brave enough to venture out to Kampai for lunch on a snow day. Either way, it was very appreciated, and definitely made my guest and I feel like they really valued us as customers. 

Okay...enough rambling. The real REAL reason I wrote this update is due to the excellence of what I got for lunch. I got a Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura combo Bento box, and it was absolutely outstanding. It was basically some delicious teriyaki chicken served on a bed of lettuce with a healthy serving of teriyaki sauce, a bunch of tempura fried veggies (flat sweet potato squares, onions, shrimp, etc), this delicious teriyaki like potato concoction, a healthy portion of white rice, and 4 pieces of California roll. All this awesomeness for only around $13...I was definitely impressed, and left feeling very, very full. I'm glad the appointment I had had was cancelled, because otherwise I definitely would have missed it, as it took me more than an hour to consume all of this delicious food. This experience just helped to further solidify my love for this place, and made me want to go back for lunch sometime very soon.

Two more quick notes, and then I'm finished. Promise. 

Note 1: Plum wine! Oh my god, it is so delicious and sweet...I have gotten it every time I've been there since I first tried it...including on this lunchtime jaunt.

Note 2: This place seems to be getting more popular (the word seems to be getting out) and I couldn't be happier. I want nothing but the best for these people, because they clearly know what they are doing and deserve success. Arrigato!",2,"good"
