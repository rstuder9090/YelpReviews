"2","I hadn't had sushi since -- how long was quarantine? -- about that long. Well maybe once but it was disappointing. So the stakes were high for Midori, a Queen village newcomer with just 6 Yelp reviews. Cut to the chase: it lived up to any dreams I had about sushi. And I'm already plotting my next visit.

It's a sparse but clean space with 3 private booths, a banquette and a few tables. With one other table filled, I felt comfortable, but would have if it were busier as it's airy and social distancing-friendly..

The service is prompt and polite and they have ""call buttons"" like on a plane or in a hospital in case you need to get the staff's attention.

There's a lunch menu with tons of $10 options give or take, including rolls plus miso and salad, or hot dishes like teriyaki, and a poke bowl which I HIGHLY recommend. The tuna was red, fresh, and plentiful. The avocados perfectly ripe. Rice well-seasoned. Spicy mushrooms delicious, and something that looked and tasted like mango, but I'm uncertain (and don't care) if it was. Perfect umami.

Give this new small business a shot -- I think you'll be happy.",1,"good"
"3","I love this new Japanese restaraunt. It has great food selections, the restaraunt is clean and warm, and the staff is friendly. I had the lunch bento box on this visit. It was plenty of food for $12. The miso soup has lots of tofu and seaweed.  The broth was rich and cloudy. The bento box had five items. The sticky rice was cooked just right. It was soft and slightly sticky. I enjoyed the marinated beef and salad. The rolls were small but the bento box still provide plenty of food for my lunch tummy. 

I also like the small subtle touches such as the background Japanese music, wet towel at the end of the meal, and custom made wooden booths. Hopefully, you will also enjoy a delicious meal here. Let me know how your experience turned out.",2,"good"
