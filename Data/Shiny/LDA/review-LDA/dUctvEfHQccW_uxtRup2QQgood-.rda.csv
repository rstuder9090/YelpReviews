"2","We met some friends here the other night for dinner. At Tsunami, guests have the option of being sat in a booth or at the large teppanyaki tables for dinner and a show. There is no price difference. We opted for the show. 

It was Friday around 730pm and we waited about half an hour. For those not in the know, Tsunami will not sit guests at the teppanyaki tables until there are 10 people to be seated. 

Our server (aka drink taker) had a trainee and seemed sort of on-guard and frazzled. My husband ordered a 2-4-1 vodka and pineapple and she kept pushing the more expensive vokda on him when he kept saying well. Very annoying. I ordered  a sake cocktail with pear that was delicious and packed a punch. 

All the meals at Tsunami come with a clear broth soup (delicious and light with mushrooms, scallions, and fried onions), a ginger salad (ok,not great), fried rice (yummy), fried noodles (delicious), 2 shrimp (an odd appetizer but very tasty), and veggies. For my protein I had steak and scallops for $26 and they were delicious. You get a decent amount of scallops for the higher price tag, which was good. My steak was cooked the way I asked and everything was seasoned well. the two sauces, a white sauce and a brown, tangy sauce, both complemented the food. 

Our chef was very talented and very engaging. He did a good job with all the tricks and added a few I've never seen at other, similar restaurants. 

This is definitely a celebration place and not really good for a casual dinner. Due to the noise, we had a hard time talking to our friends. The higher price tag will also deter us from coming often but next time we have a large group for a birthday or graduation, this would be a great place to come.",1,"good"

I would recommend reservations for groups to ensure seating and accommodations at the grill top tables. They have table service where they do not cook in front of you but these are 2 and 4 person tables mainly from what I observed. This is also the option we opted for when we dined in this time. 

The table wasn't as clean as we would have preferred and the menu was sticky but other than that, the rest of our experience was wonderful. 

We ordered the steak and shrimp entree. It started with soup and salad which was perfect to hold us until the main entree. The soup has mushrooms (watch out if you have allergies!) and I added some soy sauce for an extra kick! The salad has a wonderful ginger dressing and was just the perfect amount. Next comes the noodles! These were a nice touch as I haven't been to another hibachi style restaurant that does this. 

Then the main event, steak and shrimp. The steak was cooked medium however we ordered medium rare. It did not lack flavor and was very tender so we did not mind at all. The shrimp were wonderful! It came with rice and veggies as potatoes were in the mix as well. 

Overall, this was a great meal and so much food! Come prepared to bring home leftovers unless you are super hungry and then you can tackle this meal full force!!",2,"good"
