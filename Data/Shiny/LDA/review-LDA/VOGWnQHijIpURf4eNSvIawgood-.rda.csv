"2","Tried out the new Chinese buffet today and gotta say it was quite good. The key(trick) to this is for the quality to continue. Too many times I have experienced newly opened Chinese buffets open with a bang! Great product, friendly service, a clean restaurant, well prepared food, and then it's slowly scaled back on all fronts in order to bleed out as much profit as possible. The next thing you know the place is closed and the cycle starts all over again. Lunch was a good value at @$6.49 per person. I wish them luck and hope they continue to keep a high level of quality in all facets of their business.",1,"good"
"3","First, I don't usually write reviews but decided to do so because of what I read.  After reading the reviews, we were somewhat reluctant to visit the restauarant, especially because the former oriental restauarant, Ichabahn (spelling may be wrong) was just ok, and something I would rate as 3 stars.  However our experience at this restaurant was much, much better.  Read about fish odors and there were none.  Read about not to eat seafood:  I ate the mussels, baby clams, oysters, shirmp in 3 different ways, talapia and all tasted good.  Tried several other items and all very good, but never made it to the desert section or grill.  Restaurant was about 80% full for a Saturday night and should have be much higher due to the assortment of good food and great prices.  Some reviews may have discouraged people from eating there and understandably so.  Waitresses were all very friendly with smiling faces.  Will definitely visit again.  The only suggestions I would make to the owners are:  1.)  Beer & wine menu should always be provided without asking and prices should be shown on menu.  2.)  Add ambiance by decreasing the starkness.  3.)  Reduce the bright lights with dimmer.  3.)  Paint the ceiling a darker color to reduce the appearance of its height and make the area cozier.  4.)  Do something with the stark walls.  And doing those things will make the restaurant a very comfortable and cozy restaurant and attract more customers.",2,"good"
