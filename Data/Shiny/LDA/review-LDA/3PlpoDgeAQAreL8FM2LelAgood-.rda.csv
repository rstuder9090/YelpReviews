"2","The food at Kauboi Izakaya is incredible. The ingredients are super-fresh, expertly prepared, doused in tasty sauces (where appropriate), and beautifully plated. And if you like unpredictability and surprises in your life, Kauboi Izakaya will definitely add spice to your life. Kauboi Izakaya is located on South Virginia Street in what appears to be a former hardware or dry goods store, across from Nevada Cabinets and Lighting and from El Adobe Cafe. The store front has been whited-out to keep the afternoon sun from blasting the place, and a truck door is strategically placed to keep people from falling down a stairwell opposite the entrance. The place is sparsely decorated, with a large long-horn skull plate over the bar. The bar takes up the north side of the interior, and seats about a dozen diners facing the open kitchen. Tables for small groups are available in both the front of the dining room and the back.

The servers are very protective of their duties, and their service can be smothering. When you order a bottle of wine with your dinner, they prefer to control it, sometimes even taking it away and parking it in a wine bucket out of easy reach. They can become insulted when you actually have the audacity to pour yourself a glass. On a first visit, we ordered Pork-Shiitaki Dumplings. My wife also ordered her entree. After a timely wait her entree arrived (we forgot what it was), while we were still waiting for our dumplings, which we had ordered as an appetizer. When we asked about this the server responded that our dumplings had just gone in to the pan. Surprise! The dumplings did arrive, after we sampled the entree, and they were both delicious. I then ordered Tsukune, a chicken part meatball. It arrived as four medium seized meatballs on two skewers. Again, delicious. For my next round I ordered Crisp Pork Cutlet. When it arrived it had magically transformed itself into pork dumplings. When I pointed out to the server that this was not what I ordered, he was adamant that I was mistaken. He did finally agree to remove the dumplings, and to get my Crisp Pork Cutlet. He returned with the manager, who double checken that we really did not order dumplings (both my wife and I assured him of this). They offered us the dumplings as a peace offering for free, which we gladly accepted - they were after all delicious. My pork cutlet did arrive and it incredible. Well prepared, smothered in Bulldog Sauce, and very dreamy on my taste buds. During this visit our bottle of wine was hidden behind us in an ice bucket. On a reprise visit, I ordered the Wicked Fried Rice with Duck Crackling and Duck Egg, which was an incredible taste journey. This was followed by Tokyo Fried Chicken, equally tasty. We also enjoyed the Ahi poke with seaweed and Tobiko. I don't usually enjoy raw fish, but this dish was super-fresh and fantastic. It was during this visit that our server was a bit bent out of shape because I had they audacity to pour my own wine. On a third visit, we once again ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, and requested it be placed on our table without the ice bucket. We again ordered the pork dumplings, which arrived speedily. They again were very nicely prepared, but this time they were steamed rather than pan-fried, their filling had changed, and the sauce was not the sauce we remembered. Though the server had gone over the changes on the menu (with his back to me and in a voice that I could not hear). His finger gestures showed me which items he was describing, and the pork dumplings were not one of the ones he talked about. It would have been nice if the changes had been described or mantioned on the menu. I then ordered the Pork Tonkatsu pointing it out on the menu to prevent misunderstandings, while my wife ordered Spicy Miso Ramen. After a short wait, I was presented with a bowl of Tonkotsu with pork, a ramen dish that requires a spoon, not the crisp pork cutlet I was expecting. After a bit of back and forth, the bowl was removed and replaced by the pork cutlet. To my suprise, this pork cutlet had been change from a tenderloin to pork belly. I asked the server whether a change had been made and he assured me this dish had not changed. It had. Not only did the pork change, the sauce also change and was not identifiable by my tongue as Bulldog Sauce, but vaguely miso based (Surprise!). For my dessert I again ordered the chicken parts meatballls, and they had not been transmogrified into a different dish. Overall our visits to Kauboi Iszakaya introduced us to an incredible edible culinary experience, with several surprise twists thrown in. This restaurant will likely stay on our circuit, and is highly recommended.",1,"good"
"3","Open for about a year, Kauboi Izakaya--essentially ""cowboy gastropub"" in Japanese--serves a mixture of small plates intended to be shared amongst friends. The flavors are a mix of traditional and modern, the service was excellent, and despite the hipster ambience the experience was very welcoming and comfortable.

The menu is sectioned by size of plate and style of cooking: fresh, fried, skewered, ramen, etc. From the fresh items we sampled bowls of salmon lomi lomi with watermelon radish and crunchy quinoa ($12), and spicy soba noodles with cucumber, golden grape tomato, avocado, and Thai basil ($8).

Lomi-lomi--meaning ""to massage"" in Hawaiian--generally refers to the dish being prepared entirely by hand. The fish and veg in this bowl had definitely seen a knife--looking more poke than lomi--but it was very fresh, the quinoa added texture, and notes of toasted sesame and furikake made for a strong finish. A similar-yet-bolder use of those seasonings packed the soba bowl with plenty of savor. The noodles themselves were done just fine, the presentation was attractive, and the fresh herb and veggies worked well to balance the slightly aggressive sauce.

Of the very smallest plates offered we shared seasonal Japanese pickle ($5) and rice tots with dragon sauce ($6). The fresh pickled mix of cabbage, cauliflower, bok choy, cucumber, cherry, and ginger--garnished with Thai basil--was an explosion of bright colors and very mild, pleasant flavors. Perfect use of seasoned rice vinegar and gorgeous plating made this a stand out. The rice tots had a nice crunchy exterior, with a risotto-esque inner core that worked well with their coating of spicy sauce.

Moving on to more items from the hot oil bath, plates of Tokyo fried chicken ($10), tsukune yakitori (skewered chicken meatball, $8), beef tongue kushiyaki ($11), Kauai prawns ($15), gyoza stuffed with kurobuta pork (Japanese for ""black pig"", a variety of Berkshire pork, $8), and a grilled ""giant"" squid ($14).

Word to the wise, several of these are served straight off the grill, so give them a moment to cool off a bit and your unscorched tongue will thank you later. Each morsel of tender, juicy, boneless fried chicken was more than a couple bites, set atop a schmear of nicely spiced Japanese mayo. The meatballs had a fair amount of char, mostly due to caramelization of the sweet, soy-based sauce. They were not lacking in flavor.

Although I thought the flavor and texture was solid, everyone agreed the tongue skewers seemed a bit small. Served with a dusting of peppery prickly ash and a squirt of lemon, the little squares of tender beef were gone too quick. The gyoza were nicely browned, the fancy pig well-seasoned, pairing perfectly with thin apple slices and a daub of ginger applesauce. It wouldn't have hurt to have a little extra sauce on the plate.

The prawns were partly shelled with the tail and head left on to add sweetness while frying. Lightly coated in tempura, the sweet shellfish went very well with a dusting of garlic and yuzukosho seasoning, served with thin apple slices on the side. Not to be confused with its truly colossal cousins, the mantle of the plate-sized squid was tender and delicious. The tentacles were a bit chewy, but that can be expected when you grill the whole thing at once. The squid was sprinkled with spicy togarashi powder, more of which was sprinkled atop a dipping bowl of yuzu mayo. Way to end the meal with a bang.",2,"good"
