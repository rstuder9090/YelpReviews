"2","This was the first time we ordered from JJ Asian Cuisine.  Wanted to try a new Chinese restaurant and were pleasantly surprised to find Thai food on the menu as well as Japanese.  The hot and sour soup we ordered was good, tasted the sour but the ""hot"" needed to be kicked up a bit.  Egg rolls tasted OK but were a bit thin. Vegetable Moo Sho was good (hoisin sauce was kind of runny) and the Thia red curry w/chicken, fried tofu and vegetables was very good.

At this time, take out only. Overall, driving from Skippack was worth the trip. Food was ready and precautions in place at this time were appreciated.  Will go back.",1,"good"
"3","I have to question how genuine ""Andrew V."" is in his review. He criticizes the kung pao as both flavorless and ""overloaded with onion"".  I don't understand how you can have both of those in the same dish? Onion is ONLY flavor?.. 3/30/14, A Sunday night, at 9pm I ordered it. If I were to get a ""disappointing"" order, I'd assume it would be this time of night. A hour before closing on a Sunday. I ordered Kung pao and steamed vegetables to go. It was ready in 15 as they said, and both were above average. Kung pao was not spicy enough for those seeking the ""spicy sweats"" but did supply a very noticeable, slow, burn on the back end. Next time I would request to have some hot peppers added, but that's to my specific palate. The steam veggies and tofu that came with it were both fine. This was my first meal from JJ and will be my next as well, when I am looking for Asian cuisine in Harleysville. Most likely some sushi and General Tso.",2,"good"
"4","Conclusion: stay away unless you enjoy gambling with your food.  Tried this place many times because it is close to our fathers nursing home. Too inconsistent in quality and taste to risk spending the high money they ask. 

Pros: when good it is good (about 50% - 60% of the time).  

Cons: horrible customer service. The old woman who runs the front of the house does not care about the customer. Nobody else can do anything without her oversight. The food is inconsistent. Can be good but can be bad or even awful. 


Previous observation: Seems to be a family run place (not sure just seems that way). We have tried it several times for take out and eat in. 

The father and daughter are very nice. The mother, who I believe runs the front (seating, cashier, waitressing), is very mercenary. Do not ask for any changes from the menu as you either will not get it or you will be ""nickled and dimed"" for everything. 

As for the food, it is extremely inconsistent. There have been times when it has been good but there have been more times now where it has been bad. Unfortunately the bad goes from unpalatable to inedible; including sushi that tastes like week old bait. It makes no difference in complaining as you will get excuses not apologies or corrections.",1,"bad"
"5","Something changed. New owners maybe. Service was terrible. Young girl rushing us to order and a young boy (maybe the server's brother) running around the restaurant. Food was not the quality it used to be. Witnessed them microwaving dishes before serving to customers. Such a shame. This had been one of our favorites.",2,"bad"
