"2","This review is based on two visits and a total of four meals between three people. Also, my visit was prompted by a few unsolicited praises of this restaurant as one of their favorites.  I've been to better sushi restaurants. I've been to better Japanese steak houses. I've been to better Benihana style hibachis. I have NOT been to a better restaurant that combined the experience of all of these.

Get there EARLY. We did, were seated promptly and enjoyed our meal. We left around 5:30 and the wait for tables was very long. I bet there were people waiting equal to half the capacity of the restaurant. Nobody was anxious, and few spent their time at the bar. 

When you leave, get some butter mints. They are wonderfully rich.

The decor is off the charts good except for an ugly coke machine next to the sushi bar. Nice koi tank in the lobby. My wife does architectural drawings for retail spaces for a living. She commented about how well they balanced the space between restaurant, bar, sushi bar and Benihana style hibachi.

We sat at a booth in the restaurant. I watched a few hibachi chefs and they put on a great show.

Waitstaff is prompt, cordial and takes care of special requests. Even at their busiest, service was great. On my first visit, I arrived a bit early. They still sat me before the official opening time for the day.

The beverage menu met the approval of my adult son for quality and selection.

Now for a review of the food. All three family members contributed to this review.

- The seaweed salad was very good. It had a nice presentation and great balance of seasoning.
- My salad with the orange-ginger dressing was great. It was a nice balance of the two ingredients.
- The baby octopus sushi appetizer was good. They had a great red color, nice spice. They were tender.
- My sashimi appetizer was nice. It had a nice assortment of tuna, salmon and a mild fish I did not recognize, nor did I bother to inquire about.
- I shared my wife's Tornado sushi roll. It was plated on a round plate. It was piled high with crab and scallops with two different sauces. Hard to pick up with chop sticks but yummy.
- She also had the Dance Tuna Roll. She said it was spicy and tasty. Definitely a dish to order again.
- On a previous reconnaissance visit, I ordered the ""Smyrna Roll"". Imitation crab is not on my favorite list. I ordered it because it was a local specialty. Twelve slices were served side by side and filled the plate. They were a bit wide to pick up with chop sticks, but I managed to enjoy the wonderful balance of flavor.
- My son is an eel fan. He ordered the Uangi Don and Eel Roll. I could not get a sample because of how fast he scarfed them down. He praised them, but could not finish the rice in one dish. He took it home with the sauce.
- As a main dish, I ordered the Nabe Seafood Udon. Wow. It was huge. Aroma met my nose before I saw the server bring it. It had a nice mild smokey aroma. The cast iron pot held just short of a half gallon of food. The broth is a chef specialty and the udon, while thick and tasty, but is not made by the restaurant. All three of us tasted the udon and declared it excellent. There was so much food, I barely got to the noodles before surrendering. It was enough for two people. Again, I am not a fan of imitation crab, but dealt with it. All of the seafood was cooked to perfection. It was a great surprise to find in-shell clams. The fish cake was wonderful.

You are in the mood to sit at the hibachi grill - which I rarely do anymore - you know - if you can't stand the heat, don't sit at the hibachi. Anyway, you get your seat, maybe just you and your wife or you and a friend, getting ready for a dinner and a show. You are sitting there thinking it is just going to be you and them, then the remaining seats are suddenly filled with attractive college age ladies. The twenty-something male chef comes out and starts taking orders. He defers to you and your wife because of your age I guess. Your wife orders, then you order. The young lady beside you says, ""Oooh, that sounds delish! I'll have that, too!"" ""OMG, me, too!"" and so on and so and so on...every.last.one. Here is where I would get concerned. They're pretty, the chef is young and you are not. Of course his entire ""performance"" is going to center on them. He's going make the toy fireman fake pee on every single one of them and they are all going to scream. He is going to throw shrimp at their mouths until they each catch at least one (probably yours), then here is what is probably going to happen - you are going home hungry. Simple as that. Out of that massive pile of grilled chicken, veggies and rice - they are all going to need to-go boxes and you're going to need to go by Taco Bell on the way home...

OK, back to reality. We occasionally meet our daughter and son-in-law here for dinner. As stated in the above scenario, we rarely eat at the hibachi, choosing instead the quietness of a table or booth. Hey, they can cook my hibachi meal in the back and I won't have to worry about someone else getting half of my fried rice and I won't have a soy sauce stain on my shirt from flying shrimp! I have not had anything here I don't like. Wife loves hibachi teriyaki chicken, daughter mixes it up and usually orders something different. I order shrimp yaki udon this time - the larger noodles that are stir fried. Son-in-law always orders sashimi or something unusual, this time Chirashi Platter - assorted sashimi served over sushi rice. Mine was delicious with a generous portion of shrimp. Wife's is an abundant serving and she had to have a to-go box. Daughter had a beef dish she liked and her hubby loved his platter. Wife did not like the plum wine - cough medicine is cheaper and tastes better. 

Waitress was excellent and the food was delivered almost at the exact same time. Great place to sit and talk while you share a meal - quiet - wait - except for that dang birthday drum. While we were there, there had to have been six birthday celebrations going on. 9 out of 10 birthdays are on the hibachi side, but he starts banging that drum from back in the kitchen! It lasts for about 5 minutes for each birthday - at least it seems like it! When we talked, we tried to form our words between beats - it was that loud - and obnoxious. Hey - just give me a thumbs up if I am ever there on my birthday or some ibuprofen if you insist on the drum!",2,"good"
"4","We visited this place because they advertise they offer gluten free food and my wife in coeliac so it is very important for her not to eat gluten as it causes her to be extremely sick. We clearly told her she was coeliac and needed a gluten free dinner. We sat at the Hibachi table and they informed us that her meal was going to be prepared (correctly) in a separate area. They brought her meal but 5 minutes after she started eating, the waiter rushed to our table, took her plate away and disappeared leaving all of us (including the hibachi chef) really puzzled for what happened. About 2 min later he came with another plate saying that the previous one was wrong as it contained soy sauce (which has gluten). We were shocked! We called for the manager who didn't quite care, blamed the waiter and left. Of course my wife did not eat anything anymore and when we left we told the manager this was not a proper behavior. He laughed in our faces saying he did not charge for her meal so we could not expect anything else. I was really shocked! Of course they should not have charged for her meal as she did not eat anything and she is going to be sick for what she ate! Their behavior was honestly disgusting and we would advice avoiding this place for how they treat people!",1,"bad"
"5","Meh, this place used to be a favorite local hibachi spot. They have definitely given up on creating a good impression. The decor has not changed in probably over a decade. The food has slowly diminished in quality. I have to say I was pretty disappointed.

I brought my dad here on New Year's Day for his birthday. We waited probably 15-20 minutes for a hibachi table. I think they were short staffed. They were only filling a fraction of their hibachi tables. We probably should've sat sushi side. We were seated with another family of pre-teen children. As soon as we sat we all realized there was something wrong with the heat in the building. We were freezing. Everyone put their coats back on just to have dinner. It was freezing outside this day as well. 

We ordered a Sashimi platter. To my disappoint the pieces of salmon were frozen. Not good. I used to LOVE their fried rice here. I don't know if they stopped using an ingredient or something but the fried rice was mediocre at best. The cook added a lot of teriyaki sauce onto everything. The teriyaki sauce was given to everyone in our sauce dish as well. Umm, it was practically gelatin. It looked like it was mixed with a fat to give it more flavor maybe??? I skipped that sauce. The sauce was added onto everything  they cook here. So if you do eat here, just ask no teriyaki sauce on your steak and chicken. 

Here is the worst part. When we were initially seated the staff was singing to a little boy at another table. My dad was heartbroken that the restaurant used to serve a bowl of ice cream to guests but no longer do it. He felt bad for the little boy. He didn't even have a candle to blow out. I don't think my family and I will be visiting again.",2,"bad"
