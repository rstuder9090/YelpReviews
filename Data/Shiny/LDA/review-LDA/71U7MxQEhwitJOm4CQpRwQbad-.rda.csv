"2","Kelp sushi joint is located off bay to bay in South Tampa in a plaza next to Starbucks. Kelp Sushi Joint is located in a tiny restaurant. Unlike most other sushi bars where the bar seating faces the raw seafood display case, you get a side angle view of the sushi chefs preparing sushi as well as the chefs preparing other dishes in the back. 

Kelp sushi joint has some great $3 appetizers deals including the crab rangoon, edamame, ginger salad gyoza, miso soup, and seaweed salad.  In addition, Kelp sushi joint also has a great all day $12.95 special for any 2 classic sushi rolls and 1 starter! 

For the appetizer we ended up getting the crab rangoon and it was quite flavorful and not too dry as many tend to be 10/10. For the main course, we ended up getting the  Rose Cave Deluxe Sushi Roll which consists of  Tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, scallions, eel sauce, spicy mayo 9/10, the Florida Sushi Roll which consists of Tuna, salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and the Mexican which consists of Shrimp tempura, avocado 9/10. 

Kelp also offers Sushi burritos and bowls, which come made to order with your choice of 2 proteins, 4 vegetables, and 2 sauces including spicy mayo, jalapeno mayo, cilantro citrus aioli, teriyaki sauce, and eel sauce. Bowl options include salmon teriyaki, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, tofu teriyaki, chicken donburi, beef donburi, salmon Poke, himachi Poke, Tuna Poke, sashimi, and nigiri. Kelp does not have a liquor license and only serves beer and sake, no mixed drinks. 

I look forward to coming back to try more appetizers, a poke bowl, more sushi rolls, or a burrito roll!",1,"good"

This was our second attempt at Kelp.  First attempt was slightly after 9PM on a Friday or Saturday to find they closed at 9.  Seriously, a restaurant that closes at 9 on a weekend is weak.  I know this is Florida, but not everyone is into the early bird special.  And this play is trying to be hip, kind of new-wave sushi, yet they close basically at sunset?  Weird.

Second time around was better.  First thing you notice about Kelp is how small it is.  I think there are 6-10 tables, and the place gets busy.  There were one or two tables when we arrived, but it filled up.  They also did a tremendous amount of to-go orders.  Point being, if you want a table, it might be a crap shoot.  

We ordered 3 rolls and my girlfriend got crab rangoons.  Can't tell you about the rangoons, but the rolls were very good.  Like I said, a lot of them are far from your tradition sushi rolls - even in the specialty roll concept, they were a bit far out.  For example, we got the Desert Oasis roll, which has mango and a thai chili sauce.  Sounds strange, right?  I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was actually my favorite.  We also got a Underwater Lake roll, which has boiled shrimp, cucumber, avocado and krab salad - also very good, but again, not very traditional.  Finally, we got a Salt Cove roll, which was spicy shrimp, smoked salmon with jalapeno.  This one I didn't care for, and I've had sushi with jalapeno before and really liked it, but in my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well together here.

So really, I'm deducting a bit for that last roll, but the others were very good.  And to Kelp's credit, they go light on the rice, heavy on the fish.  Drawbacks to Kelp, besides the size, are the options and prices.  They don't have a very extensive menu - 23 rolls (I think) and some appetizers.  Seems like a lot, but that's maybe 1/2 a sushi menu at other places.  Additionally, they are mostly specialty rolls.  They do not have too many of your regular run-of-the-mill rolls.  Finally, price wise, most of the rolls are over $10.  So if you're looking for your regular $6-$8 sushi rolls, this isn't for you.  But if you want to try something different, and really enjoy it, I think you should give Kelp a try",2,"good"
"4","The wife and I have been frequent customers since Kelp opened, and we considered it the humble gem of sushi in Tampa. It was reasonably priced, the food was excellent, and the menu was exceptional - especially since the mrs is a leaf eater. However, recent changes have left us wanting.

The new menu just doesn't add up. Prices have risen. Nearly all of the former vegetarian options have been removed. This evening when we stopped in, they had no tofu - a sushi joint that has no tofu, on a Friday night. The roll options have been limited and the rolls that are left are unimaginative on the whole. The miso doesn't taste as good as it used to either. After finding out about the tofu shortage we walked out, and we were both sad about it.

Twice now (the last being this very evening) we've been in and had the same server; a tall, thin, younger woman with blonde hair, lack of politeness, and poor disposition. Both times she wore mannerisms and had a tone that suggested we were an inconvenience for being there. We're approached with ""What do you want,"" verbatim, with an upward inflection. The last time we were in, we had to approach her for the bill and to get the bill processed after having to wait for her social group at the register to disperse. She is not a good server and really shouldn't be interacting with customers. Poor judgement call by management there.

The new menu is underwhelming. It feels more like they're trying to shift to trends rather than excellent food. And the service has been subpar recently. I really resisted reviewing the last time we were in, but after tonight I'm dropping one. We used to recommend Kelp over even Samurai Blue. Not anymore.",1,"bad"
"5","I'll start by saying I don't write negative Yelp reviews and the food at kelp is great. I'm writing this in hopes the the owner is able to see it and take a long hard look at their staff as there seems to be a culture being built that deems it acceptable to be rude to customers. We live around the corner and have been to kelp many times. Last night we called in a pickup order at 9:28pm, the restaurant closes at 10pm (keep in mind it's a Saturday night). What seemed to be a shift manager up front (she had a slight Caribbean accent, wearing a green jacket) immediately began to guilt us over the phone ""why do you people always call in these orders at 9:30 when my kitchen is closing in 30 minutes"". What started as playful and sarcastic grew to get more and more serious, we must have been badgered 4 or 5 more times on the phone ""hurry up, what else do you want"". I tried to make light of the situation coming in and the heckling persisted. All of the chairs were up and the floors were being mopped at 9:45, employees grilling us as we walked in the door as if we were SUCH an inconvenience. We got our food and despite having enough time to heckle us for 10 minutes, they didn't have enough time to get our order right. Edamame, ginger salad, and a roll were missing. Rolling eyes coming from the kitchen left and right when we discovered this. They got our roll and ginger salad but we're ""out of edamame as of 30 second ago"". Looked at me as if it was my problem. After some back and forth I agreed to take a cold dumpling box sitting on the table in exchange for the edamame, considering it was already paid for. Food was great per usual, but if you own this place, take a hard look at your staff. I have worked in hospitality for 7 years and this is not just one bad apple, you have a culture of negativity brewing in your staff that will keep me from coming back. Too many good options out there to feel shamed into giving you my $50 for pickup.",2,"bad"
