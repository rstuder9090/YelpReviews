"2","Watch out, kids.  There's a new sushi bully on the block.  I had sushi from Sakana several months ago, and it was good.  When I heard the ownership had changed, I jumped to test it out.  Who was Jay?  Did I care what his favorite sushi bar was?  The first night I was pleasantly surprised.   I ordered again two nights later.  It tasted better.  Tonight was my sixth order over the past few weeks, and I sit at my computer with the taste of the sea lingering on my palate.  The seaweed salad was fine, as was the soup, but it is with the quality of the fish, the deft touch of the gentlemen behind the bar and its incredible value that make this a five star restaurant.  The sashimi platter brought ruby-fleshed tuna, at perfect temperature, along side yellowtail snapper so rich I felt like I had my tongue in a vat of butter.  Albacore, or white tuna, at its worst takes like salt and a piece of turkey that's five days past its prime.  At its best, its pure flavor, creamy and savory with a touch of umami, can elevate the tongue through the stratosphere.  At Jay's Favorite, it is fish in its prime.  As is the salmon.  It tastes so fresh, I feel like I could be eating on some boat in Alaska where it was caught minutes before.  It may be farmed.  I don't know.  It tastes fantastic, though.  There is crab stick on the plate as well.  I happen to like this, though I have never seen it before on a sashimi plate.  The yellowtail roll I ordered was well made.  The rice was very good; and again, the fish was as delicate as a young flower, certainly feeling the savory sting of the chopped scallions but able to hold her own, creating perfect harmony within the walls of seaweed.  I rounded out my order with with 2 pieces of wasabi tobiko sushi. (I had ordered mackerel nigiri in the past, the fish demonstrating the perfect ratio of vinegary tang and oils.)  The wasabi tobiko was the weak point of the night owning to its surprising lack of horseradish bite.  When I eat a heap of wasabi tobiko, I want my nose to run and my brain to release a surge of endorphins because it is so hot.  I didn't feel any of that.   Still, the meal as whole is easily 5-star worthy.  I would pay Chestnut street prices for sushi this good.  Yet I don't have to, as Jay also knows his value.  There are a ton of special rolls on the menu, yet I have not indulged.  Alas, I wrestle with a full-sized spare tire, the only redeeming feature of which is it draws attention away from my several chins.  However, the deep-fried, tempura flaked,  cream cheese stuffed bites of heaven may prove more than I can resist.",1,"good"
"3","If you liked Vic's in the OLD Days (when Vic & his wife first opened) you'll like Jay's.  Jay (and Martin) worked with Vic for a while.  Many of the crazy (and a bit over-sauced - get your sauce on the side - problem solved), calorie-laden specialty rolls are just like Vic's but sub lobster for crab and have different names.

My first visit (a few minutes ago) I ordered 2 things - tuna dumplings (divine) - and the eggplant lady.

Both are apps. - but that was just perfect for little ole me.

The $7.50 order of 2 hand-flattened tuna pouches came bursting with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy mixture of lobster (real) and crab (fake) salad with masago and avocado.  Creamy, fattening, non-traditional goodness.

The $4.25 eggplant lady (I will re-order this for sure) had 2crispy-thin tempura slices of purple japanese eggplant.  The eggplant was luscious, crisp slice was topped with chopped shrimp and (fake) crab salad (more avocado, masago, kewpie - like my hips needed THAT!), topped with sliver-sliced avo and eel sauce.

(Next time - no sauce.)

This is NOT a place to get traditional nigiri.  (The tamago is frozen, and there's no way that Inari is home made)  It is a place for ""fun-food"" rolls as a treat.  Purists won't like it, but Phat-Philly types should LOVE it here.

The service was Excellent - but Jay is new and eager to please.  I anticipate visiting againsoon - and I'd bet money on it that the 6-seat sushi bar (and tables for about 14 more - It's bigger than Vic's - andthey actually serve you your drinks) will be MUCH more crowded.

So in summary:  Sushi-newbie?  Great place for you.  Fresh-fish, sashimi purist?  Probably not.

For me - there is a time and place for everything.  Tonight was my time for the 2 month old Jay's.

I sure hope the quality doesn't deteriorate in 6 months.",2,"good"
"4","Jay's Favorite Sushi Bar has one less fan. The acid burn from the overabundance of spicy sauce woke me up in the middle of the night. There's too much spicy sauce in their imitation crab meat salad (really just slivered kani ""crab"" soaked in spicy sauce) and an overkill of Japanese panko bread crumbs. I want to basically ask WHY WHY WHY?????

My friend Chris and I started with the tuna dumplings, which were huge. Lots of tuna wrapped around a huge wad of imitation crab with little bits of lobster in it. The biggest mistake any sushi joint can make is to say you get crab when it's really imitation crab. I'm sorry, but imitation crab is not crab. It's fish meatloaf! The dumplings were the size of baseballs. Sure, you get a lot of food for your money, but is more really better? No, not in this case. About halfway into the dumpling, I felt that Jay's could've simply made a smaller tuna dumpling with real lobster and crab meat instead of this fake crab junk. The huge mound of Japanese panko bread crumbs covering the plate was just offensive. Why kill this dish with so many bread crumbs? You just need a light sprinkling of crumbs on the plate!

Chris got a sashimi platter and I got a Revive Fire roll which was supposed to be a softshell crab roll with spicy crab on top. My roll was quite possibly the worst softshell crab roll I've ever had. The softshell crab was heavily breaded, dry, and not the wonderful crab experience I've had at Shiroi Hana, Hikaru, Fuji Mountain, or Morimoto. To make matters worse, that yucky imitation crab meat salad was sitting on top of each piece. Yucky. Chris' platter was not very attractive. It was basically a rectangular plate with five sets of sliced fish: tuna, salmon, hamachi, white fish, and white tuna. Chris also got a Sakura roll which was supposed to be Spicy Crabmeat topped with Shrimp, Spicy Mayo Sauce and Massago and wrapped in soy paper. It was just more of the same yucky imitation crab meat salad with shrimp in it. By the time I tried a piece of his roll, I had had enough of Jay's.

I should've seen the clues in the pictures. Lots of ""inventive"" sushi rolls doused in a lot of colorful sauces. In fact, some of the rolls are swimming in a disgusting overabundance of sauce. Every roll, sushi, or sashimi is ""He man-sized"" so you get big value for your money. This is not the kind of sushi I like to eat. I'd rather eat sushi that is small and delicate and seasoned just right. Jay's Favorite Sushi Bar will certainly have its fans, those people who aim to fill their bellies with one menu item for under $10. It's just not sushi as I like it.",1,"bad"
"5","I watched. I watched quietly and from the confines of my seat at the sushi bar, while dismayed customers shifted back and forth from one foot to the other. A takeout order for a customer, our CM Michelle nonetheless, took almost the same amount of time to surface as my co-workers and my ""meal"" in-house...judging by her nonstop checking of the blackberry, she'd been there a good deal longer than we had. I snickered to my co-worker that I couldn't wait to read what she would write about her experience, I voted one star, clearly she was being generous. The last laugh was on us though, after the room started to clear of the business lunch rush, out came our two minuscule rolls. My co-worker is not a small guy, but typically a two-roll special will suffice us both...this was just absurd. The ""lobster salad"" roll consisted of pieces no bigger than the distal phalanx of my left thumb (my right thumb's bigger than my left) and the american roll was so sloppily made that it fell apart in transit from my soy sauce dish to my mouth. 

The waitress seemed a bit harried, I think she might have been the only one taking care of the lunch rush and there seemed to be some miscommunication between her and the sushi chefs as orders were questioned on more than one occasion in front of our faces. This waitress also had a bit of a problem with social interaction, namely that she was a bit too friendly. I like to have my personal space to myself, but she was all up in my face asking what drink I wanted and trying to take my order.

Maybe this was just an off day, but it seems like more and more reviews are falling from the 4-star+ category at an alarming rate. Come on Jay, why you have to do me like this? I thought I had found a solid sushi joint for a quick lunch, I am disappointed...shame on you.",2,"bad"
