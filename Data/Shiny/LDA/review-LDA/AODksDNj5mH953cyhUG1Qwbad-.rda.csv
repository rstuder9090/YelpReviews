"2","Was really craving Pad Thai and found this spot on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  It was about 45mins prior to their closing so we placed the order online and headed right over to pick it up.

The restaurant is off the side of a main road, and is very easy to drive right by if you're not paying attention -- so be attentive and slow down early.

There are about three parking spots in front and a few more to the left of the building.  Due to COVID they are only doing take out and delivery, with the option of eating your food on one of their outside bench tables, with an umbrella to help block the sun.

I ordered a tofu and shrimp pad thai which came out to be about $14.  The portion size here is definitely for a family as the pad thai lasted me for 4 meals!  The Thai Hot was spicy and had good flavor but I feel it completely took away from the other flavors pad thai should have; e.g. tamarind.  Nonetheless the pad thai was great here and I would definitely order it again.

The following day, because the pad thai was so good, I wanted to try something else on their menu.  So I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken in medium this time.  Same deal here with the portion size, although this one lasted me only 3 meals -- thinking it was the extra protein that allows for an extra meal.  The flavor was great, but the heat for medium was not hot enough, so thinking next time I'll try their hot (in between medium and Thai hot).

If you're in the area and craving Thai food, so far, this is the place to beat.",1,"good"
"3","I ordered take-out from Thai 5 after reading many stellar reviews and was quite pleased with my decision! The Crab Rangoon - which is served with Thai sweet chili sauce - was a very tasty starter; I wished the wonton ends were less crispy/hard, but I happily ate the center stuffing and it was delicious! 

After learning from Yelp that the Crab fried rice and Pumpkin Panang Curry were popular entree choices, I decided that I wanted to try both. So I asked the gentleman over the phone if I could order the Pumpkin Panang with chicken and jasmine rice - as well as a side of the crab fried rice (since I really just wanted to try it). Since the menu did not reflect the ability to add side orders, he kindly indicated that he could input a ""half portion"" - which was fine by me. The half portion ended up being HUGE (basically seemed like a full entree serving...just see the picture I uploaded if you're in doubt). 

I appreciated Thai 5's flexibility by graciously accommodating my request.  This showed me that their customer service efforts are truly exceptional. He asked if I wanted the regular fried rice or the spicy fried rice. I didn't recall reading about the spicy fried rice on Yelp or on the menu, so I asked for his opinion. He said that the spicy kind is more popular and that it would be good with the crab. As it turns out, I absolutely HATED the spicy fried rice with crab. I took two bites and ended up tossing the whole thing. Rather than discrediting the restaurant for this, I attributed this experience to my personal taste. It was way too peppery and the spices really took away from the taste of egg and other ingredients (an appeal that fried rice traditionally offers). I also wondered if I was more adverse to the seafood aspect of this dish - this was a dish that I just wanted to try, and now I know, the crab spicy fried rice is not for me. 

The Pumpkin Panang with chicken, on the other hand was DELICIOUS! I love that this entree is available year round (since many restaurants only offer Pumpkin flavored entrees during the fall season). This was the first Thai restaurant I have ordered from in Tampa that has offered the Pumpkin Panang flavor. The dish could have been slightly sweeter and the potatoes were too soft to stick my fork into, but the consistency of the sauce and the generous serving of chicken was just enough to satiate my appetite!  

I'll definitely be back with the hopes of trying their coconut rice and more of what Thai 5 has to offer!",2,"good"
"4","One star because this is the lowest I can give. I wish there were no stars. No stars like I have NO dinner because this restaurant was a cluster tonight. I hesitate to leave this as the possibly underage kid working will be the scapegoat and I don't want him to get in trouble but the mother, Chanel, has already placed blame on him. 

I technically ordered two soups without cilantro and two ginger salads. I ordered through a woman. I was quoted 25 minutes for what ended up to be 45 minutes. There was no ginger dressing and I was offered very bizarre substitutes (spicy mayo on a salad?!) and ultimately got a refund for that. When I got home, I realized there was cilantro in both soups and all over my appetizer of steamed dumplings  (I didn't ask if that had cilantro but wonder if common sense or a diligent order taker would take over at that point and let me know that cilantro is all over the dumplings, too?). 

When I called, Chanel said that she apologizes but her son took the order - NOT TRUE. I had a very long conversation with her son when he was having to refund me the first time around. I also heard him take several phone calls while I waited the extra twenty minutes. While I was on the phone, she also said I cursed at her. I definitely did not. I believe she said this to make me look bad in front of the customers she said were waiting there. Just like she blamed her poor son (who was sniffling (a cold perhaps?) and trying to manage the front of the house the whole time. 

First time trying and I will never go back and will absolutely NEVER recommend this place. They need to get their act together and perhaps stop taking grubhub orders (I saw several come through) when they can't manage the standard orders coming in. Chanel's behavior alone would keep me away. I feel bad for her son. Maybe he can get a job a Jazz Thai down the road when he's old enough.",1,"bad"
"5","Good food, but be prepared to wait- sometimes MUCH longer than they tell you.
My wife and I enjoy the food from Thai 5 and typically patronize the place once or twice a month. We've been customers ever since they took over the space from Kombo Kitchen. The food is good, but the personnel's estimates of wait times are severely lacking.
The past several times that we've called in to order food, we've shown up at the time that the food was supposed to be ready (""30 minutes"", ""45 minutes"", etc.), but have had to wait another 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or more before the food was actually ready.
Most recently, we ordered our food (two entrees and an order of spring rolls) at 6:30pm and were told that it would be ready 45 minutes later. Upon our arrival at the trailer at 7:15pm, we were told ""Your food is almost ready. Please wait in your car and we'll bring it out to you"".  After waiting for 25 minutes, then walking back to the window to inquire about the status of our order, we were told ""I'm sorry, but look at all of the orders we have"" (while pointing to tickets hanging from the rack). The food was finally ready a few minutes before 8:00pm (almost 90 minutes after we ordered it- double the time that we were quoted). Upon asking why there was such a discrepancy between the estimated time and the actual time of the food being ready, we were told ""I'm sorry, but I wasn't the person that took your order"".
Because of the prices that they charge and the long wait that's required to actually get the food, you're better off patronizing other places nearby that offer better value and more timely service: Chef Thai & Sushi, Thailand Restaurant, Royal Palace, etc.",2,"bad"
