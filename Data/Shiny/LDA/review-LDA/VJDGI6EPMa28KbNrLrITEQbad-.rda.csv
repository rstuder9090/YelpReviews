"2","Summary: a good Japanese/Asian restaurant with something for everyone (it's a big menu)!

I came here with my friend on a Thursday night! It wasn't packed but it wasn't full and wait times for the food were good even though they said it would take some time! The waiters were very nice and kept checking in on us to see if everything was fine! I found this to be one of the better sushi spots than many others I've tried (but haven't reviewed) in Tampa.

Spice Tuna Tacos- these were great appetizers! Light & fresh tasting (a lot of sushi restaurants in tampa, I find, don't have very fresh tasting fish). The shells were thick and crispy (maybe too thick?) and the sauce it was covered in was lightly salted (probably soy) sweetened with some sugar! Only issue I have with it is that I really didn't taste or see any or very little cucumber. That would have made this very refreshing.  4/5

Nabeyaki Udon- this was a delicious soup! However, we were wishing there was more broth or less tempura bits in the soup because it took all the broth. The flavour was awesome and the udon was a nice thickness but I wish if were a little bit more elastic. Ithat elasticness would have given it a chewier Texture. The tempura bits were great (you also get a tempura sweet potato slice, which was not mentioned). Everything that was served with the soup tasted fresh and nice. 4/5

[Fire] Volcano Roll- it was my preferred of the two special rolls we ordered! My main complaint was that this was extremely saucy- to the point where you couldn't taste the fish. This would be great for non-sushi lovers, but not great for people who like the fresh taste of the fish. The broiled salmon was delicious with the sauce though. Otherwise, the the California roll was delicious. 4/5

Double Spicy Tuna Roll- it's literally double the tuna you would get in a regular roll. My complaint would be the same as the volcano roll, too much sauce and mayo on it! This would have been a great if it weren't drowned by the sauces and the cream cheese. 3/5",1,"good"
"3","Didn't realize this place had a sushi buffet during the week. Had lunch there on Thursday and left full and satisfied. The sushi was fresh and there was a decent amount of variety to choose from. This restaurant serves more than the traditional Japanese fare. They also have a mongolian style barbecue with chicken, pork, or shrimp.  Additionally, they have a limited selection of Korean food with some of the well known side dishes like kimchi and other pickled vegetables.

The ambiance and decor was pleasant and not over the top. There were plenty of tables and booths to accommodate a decent crowd.  Having only eaten here at lunch, I had a strong impression that this restaurant had a good local following. I was impressed that the waitress remembered some of the ""regular"" customers by name and drink preference.
Overall, this place wasn't bad at all. The buffet can set you back $15 per person, so make sure you come hungry.",2,"good"
"4","I've eaten in the restaurant once before (unfriendly service, it felt like our party of 8 with our almost $300 bill on a week night was wasting the server's time), and the food was good, not great, but good enough to want to order take out tonight for dinner. Ordering Ginza was also due to lack of other options in the area, as a disclaimer. I came to Yelp to find the menu but it's not listed so I called and asked if they could fax or email a menu to me since they don't have a website, the lady said no. I asked if there was another website or somewhere online that I could go to see it, she said yes and hung up on me. I called back and she said to look on Yelp, I told her it's not listed there, she said ok then no and hung up again. If their customer service is that lacking when someone is trying to order dinner and it's even more lacking towards customers in the restaurant, how do they expect to get and keep repeat customers? I will drive further to pick up food from another restaurant that I feel is thankful for my business.",1,"bad"
"5","Nothing impressive about this place other than the nice staff & clean environment. I hesitated ordering the buffet because of the price ($15) but decided to because the lunch entrees were a bit much & for $2 more I could have sushi. Well let's start there...I arrived around 12:30 & I would almost swear the sushi was leftover. While the tuna & salmon looked & smelled ok... the tuna & salmon in the rolls were dark in color (kinda scary) & not pretty at all. The buffet items were exremely limited & had the appearance of being old. The cucumbers in the cucumber salad had no crunch what so ever & a earthy smell.  Thank goodness for the hibachi veggies, lettuce & ok salad dressing (otherwise it would have been a total loss). I feel fine today (didn't get sick at all) but I will not return (bummer due to its location & my tweens love for sushi).

oh!! & the fact I had to leave my raw veggie plate (to be cooked) at the end of the bar & walk off was really uncomfortable in a place with other customers standing near (praying no one sneezed).",2,"bad"
