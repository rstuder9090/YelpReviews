"2","Needed to grab a quick and easy dinner one night while we were out and about in Central West End. Walking past Poke Doke, my boyfriend and I were both very interested! While we really were looking to dine-in, we decided the offerings at Poke Doke were well worth a grab and go situation. 

Ordering was really easy online. You picked your size and base. We both got soba noodles, but I ALMOST got the wonton chips. Next you select your poke and mix ins. I ordered Ahi and Spicy Tuna. Finally you picked your toppings and drizzles. They had so many awesome options. I chose avocado, edamame, crabmeat, masago and ginger. The drizzles all sounded so good, and I'm a sauce feind! I'm not even ashamed to say that I got my bowl topped with spicy mayo, teriyaki mayo, sweet thai chili, soy sauce and gochujang. There was a moment after I hit submit that I may have gone overboard on the sauces, but you only live once dear reader.

Shout out to the AMAZINGLY friendly employees of Poke Doke who made my meal so deliciously. Thanks for being awesome Ronnie, Ashley, Eric and John!! Y'all are fantastic for helping us get our grub during the pandemic. 

Picking up the food was very easy. There was a table just inside the entrance. You grabbed your bag and bolted. Easy as that! 

The bowls were so good. In my head I wanted to pretend like it was a light and healthy meal. But with all that mayo I added... I definitely had to run a few extra miles the next day. All of the toppings tasted extremely fresh. I highly suggest adding crabmeat. That was my favorite part and wish I would have added an extra scoop of it on my bowl. Can't wait to return to Poke Doke for another bowl.",1,"good"
"3","I've had Poke a few different places around the country but none have them have been in coastal areas.  That said, I don't know that the sashimi-grade fish used in Poke is going to vary a lot as I believe most of it is brought in frozen.  Salmon and tuna are pretty run-of-the-mill these days and the rest of the stuff offered is pre-cooked.  Besides, truly magnificent fish has no business being doused in sauce, co-mingled with a dozen ingredients and then squirted with even more sauce.

I had a small bowl for $10.  There were a lot of choices to be made and I started with the white sushi rice then selected the salmon & octopus for my proteins, added edamame (not listed as a protein but it is), sliced cucumbers, masago, wasabi, ginger, fake crab, fried onions, seaweed salad, a shot of eel sauce and a dash of sesame seeds to complete the dish.  I wouldn't say that it had the eye appeal of a well-made plate of nigiri or sashimi but you can't get either of those for ten bucks.

What should be fresh was fresh.  What should be crisp was crisp.  What should be...was.  Everything was competently made and the overall bowl was delicious.  While Poke is really not a substitute for sushi or sashimi in my book it is a good way to enjoy some of the same ingredients and you walk away full but not stuffed.

I've yet to reach the pinnacle of Poke available in the US but I do believe that PokeDoke puts out a very respectable product at a fair price and it is better than any of the other places I've tried thus far.",2,"good"
"4","Right next to Barnes and Jewish, this place is way more convenient for me than the Blk Market. But - this restaurant fails mainly in it's execution. First, if you say you are gluten free - have a list or train your employees. Some of the staff are great and others are meh. And please have your employees wear gloves. I saw them dump frozen crab raggon with their bare hands. And I've been here now multiple times and although the food is decent and it's getting better. I am not the biggest fan. 

Things to Note:
1) Three sizes: 2 - 4 tiny scoops. The large is equal to the standard at the Blk Market competitor.
2) Lots of seating and it is hot inside
3) Fish needs to be colder. This is the thing that bothers me the most
4) Quality of Tuna is much lower than Blk Market and not seasoned well
5) They have soba noodles
6) Wifi is coming. Oooo
7) Customize your own, but there isn't a opt in standard if you don't know how to mix/match

Pros:
1) Lots of Seaweed Salad
2) Choose whatever toppings but avocado is extra

Cons:
1) Seems like they always run out of stuff, and they didn't even have a simple spicy mayo sauce left by 1pm. Make more!
2) Not generous with their scoops or they just need bigger spoons! Or make sure u just get the large scoops bc of the ratio/rice/salad.
3) Warm rice was too mushy
4) Basic mix salads and they emptied the edamame right out of the frozen bag

I love Poki but this place is the reason why you shouldn't have Poki in the midwest. Raw fish should be cold! If this is your first time with Poki, then it's decent. But - def. go to the Blk Market which is like down the street for better Poki and fresher ingredients.

"5","First off let me just say that finding a poke restaurant in St. Louis is like finding a mermaid colony in the middle of a desert. It's nothing short of a miracle. I've eaten plenty of poke in my life and travels from California to Hawaii so I was excited to try this place out. I came here on Day 3 after they officially opened and SO BADLY wanted to love this place. Here's why I didn't: 

1. Not worth it for the price point. $10 for a bowl with three scoops of poke. And we are talking about the world's tiniest scoops, like somewhere between a teaspoon and tablespoon of fish per scoop. Majority of my bowl was rice. Maybe it's just my preference, but I AM willing to pay a little more for better quality and more reasonable portions of fish.

2. Aside from the bowl, they charge $5 for a boba tea which was mediocre at best. Used basic powder for the tea base and the boba was hard and sticking in giant clumps at the bottom. 

3. For whatever reason both my friend and I felt a little nauseous and ill a couple hours after eating here, and the discomfort lasted for some time. This makes me question the freshness of their ingredients as well as the sanitation because we're dealing with raw fish here. 

4. We left feeling half-full and still hungry, and this was after I had spent $15 on my meal and drink, not including tax. 

Since this is the first restaurant of its kind in town, I guess I had too high of expectations for this place. I'd like for them to succeed and improve the experience for future diners, so here's the positives: 

1. Aside from the meager fish portions, they are pretty generous with the toppings, and there's a good variety of those. Also a solid selection of sauces from eel sauce to wasabi mayo. 

2. Service was good - staff was super friendly and our food and drinks were prepared quickly. 

3. Nice ambience - modern decor with a relaxed casual feel and you have a lot of freedom to customize your meal while watching it be prepared in front of you. 


Best of luck, Poke Doke. I'll upgrade my review as needed.",2,"bad"
