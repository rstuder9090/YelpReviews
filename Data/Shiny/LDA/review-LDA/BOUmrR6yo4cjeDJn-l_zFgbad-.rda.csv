"2","Amazing Asian food restaurant in Roxborough, Manayunk area. Me and my wife really enjoy Dream House. Thank God it's something different than the average Chinese food restaurant.

Here are the positives;

Inside is very nice, modern, and clean. A great place to get sushi with friends, or go on a date with the wife. The host/waiter is extremely friendly!

Thai food section on the menu is unique! I tried the Thai Curry and it was very delicious. Not too strong, not too coconut milk tasting. The rice was very good. I also had The House Specialty, Crispy Beef. It came over salad with a special soy sauce. Me and my wife loved this! 

I read that another reviewer said that the Gen Tso had pineapple that's awesome! Sick of regular Chinese food.


Negatives;

Be more specific on menu. Could use better more modern, and more descriptive menu! This would have prevented the General Tso -Pineapple problem as they could have two kinds listed, one with pineapple and one without. Or the menu could have been more explicit about it having Pineapple in it in the first place.

Warning the veggie dumplings are very unique. Kind of like egg roll style filling (or also similar to cole slaw), not bad though, they should specify on their menu that this is very different as some people will be surprised.

I'm a big fan of Dream House and will go here again! If the menu get's better I'll give this place 5 stars!",1,"good"
"3","We decided to explore restaurants in the Roxborough/Manayunk area and stumbled upon this place.

The menu is big, but most of it is Americanized Chinese food, which me mostly avoided.  We ordered Bento Box specials, which were an incredible deal--$9 for a huge amount of food: soup, sushi, salad, rice, two dumplings, and an entree.  There was also complimentary tea, which tasted like some sort of mild, roasted tea like hojicha or roasted barley tea.

The sushi was top-notch; it was just a California roll, but it was the best California roll I've had in a long time.  There was only a sparing amount of rice around the outside of the roll, and it was very generous with the other ingredients, which were very fresh.

I ordered the salmon green curry and it was exquisite...it came with the skin on (which I like) but was cooked so it was tender and easy to eat, and there were no bones in it.  That's tricky to do!  The sauce was mild--I'm used to Thai green curry being spicier and there was little kick but it was flavorful.

We got hot and sour soup with our meal and it was good, again, not very hot, but good.  The only thing I was less a fan of were the dumplings, which were a crab rangoon-style dumpling, cream cheese and crab, too heavy and not really my thing.

I would come back here though.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was very good, especially the sushi.  I want to try more extensive sushi here because I was so impressed with the quality of the California rolls.",2,"good"
"4","Poor taste and poor service.

My wife and I came here because she has been craving pad Thai. 
After our visit she is still craving pad Thai. 
The portion sizes were huge but the taste was minimal.
The pad Thai was orange, it had no visible vegetables and herbs, and was sweet, not spicy as the menu indicates.
My wife did say the shrimp was cooked perfectly but that was the only positive thing she could say about the dish.

After 2 bites of the pad Thai my wife couldn't stomach anymore so we decided to speak to the waiter. We called for the waiter, literally, we had to call out across the restaurant because every time we needed something he was busy on his phone or watching Avengers on the TV. We expressed the problem to the waiter and asked if we could replace the meal with something different to which he agreed. After looking over the menu again my wife decided she didn't want anything more.

I had the beef with broccoli bento box lunch special. Aside from way too much brown sauce it was ok and a decent price.

We asked for the bill and the waiter brought out a takeaway box and the bill. Before I could say anything more he was gone again. When we finally got the waiter back I asked, ""why we were being charged for something we didn't eat?"" We were told ""because you ordered it. We have to just dump it."" To which I replied ""yes, but my wife did not eat it. It made her sick to the stomach. We should not have to pay for something we didn't eat."" I was then told he could charge half price but not take it off the bill. He said they would replace it with something different but that was all. By this point I was done with giving this place a chance so we ordered something different to takeaway. It wasn't something that I wanted but it was something rather than pay for a dish that made my wife sick.

This place may be called dream house but be assured the dreams here are not very pleasant.
Save your money and your time.",1,"bad"
"5","If there was a ZERO star rating, this place deserves it!! The service is absolutely awful and the server was very rude. Besides telling us to sit where ever we want (the place was completely empty, that should have been a clue). We were served only warm tap water with ice, not the traditional tea. When I asked if they had cooked sushi, he said in a bitchy tone ""you can't come to a sushi restaurant and expect to find cooked sushi"" and walked off. Not even trying to understand what I was wanting or other options they may have. After 5 minutes he comes back and tells me to flip the page and there is cooked and raw rolls. Why couldn't he have done this before. He disappears again for 5 minutes. We order our rolls and wait for 20 minutes before our order arrives. He doesn't return to check on us, check to see if we like our food, if we needed anything or nothing. He just sat in the back of the restaurant eating his lunch. When I got his attention I asked him what kind of fried wontons they had. He said...""pork"". We asked if they had chicken and he replied ""We only eat pork wontons, never chicken"". Again very rudely! During the meal, I had finished my water, he didn't even check to see if I wanted more. I flagged him down to ask for more water. By this time, I didn't want it anymore, but I just wanted him to do it.  I couldn't wait to get out of there. Got the bill and didn't even wait for him to come back, I went directly to the counter to pay. It hurt me to pay $45 for a meal I didn't enjoy and awful service. 
I will never return to this place! Not just for the terrible & rude service but also for the less than ordinary food. 
SAVE YOURSELF (AND YOUR $$)  & STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!",2,"bad"
