"2","My wife is the Sushi Sensei.  What she likes about Sake as she can easily change her route home and stop there for the happy hour specials if I've had a big lunch and don't really want much for dinner.  I visit less often, but when I go, it is usually for dinner.  Obviously, she eats here a lot more often than I do.  

You walk in the restaurant and to the right is the bar area.  We tend to go straight into the restaurant.  Up front, are standard strip mall plate glass windows looking out on Clearview.  Further back, the glass is replaced by wall and you have more of the feeling of a sushi restaurant.  It does change the ambiance of the meal, where you sit.

On our last visit, we started off with an order of Edamame.  Then we shared orders of their Rocky II rolls and the Breezy rolls.  I wasn't too thrilled with their Rocky II rolls.  However, the Breezy rolls were something else.  It might not be to the taste of a true sushi gourmet due to the cream cheese in the roll, but I liked the combination of the snow crab, crawfish, and avocado mixed with the cream cheese.  The rolls were lightly fried and topped with tuna.

We had no complaints about the service which was quick and efficient.",1,"good"
"3","I would normally give this joint 3 stars but the service and the specials put it in 4 star range!  After working out as a guest at Elmwood Fitness Center, one of my girlfriends and I were starving and ate here.  Since it was an amazing night we sat outside which was wonderful because we had the tables to ourselves.  And the hostess was super sweet after she tried to seat me at one table inside, then I asked to move to another table, then my girlfriend didn't see me so I sat outside and I moved again!  She took it all in stride.

So one of the specials was half bottle night so we picked a chardonnay and shared it.  It even had a screw top which made it convenient to bring it home.  Another awesome item on their menu is where you can order three different types of sushi for like $13 and it includes miso soup and a salad!  What?  So both of us got that deal. All I remembered was that I ordered the salmon avocado roll, a second one with salmon and I forgot the third roll. They were all tasty!

And I totally forgot the appetizer but it's a tender fish that was falling off the bone! Delish!

One thing my gf taught me was to use ponzu sauce instead of soy sauce with sushi and it's better flavor! Worked for me!

Happy Japanese food eating!",2,"good"
"4","My friend and I tried to eat here last night (it was 9:30pm), and website hours said close time was 10pm, as well as the hours listed on the door of the restaurant. The two employees there were so beyond rude, had the doors locked and said they were closed. They couldn't even give us a reason as to why they were closed. Finally she blurted we have cleaning to do. The manager came out, and her attitude was even more deplorable than the employee's. I've been eating a sake caf√© for 15+ years now, and I will never step foot inside of one again after last night. The sushi isn't even good enough to put up with rude employees. I understand unexpected things come up in this industry, but a simple - we are so sorry we had to close early due to ________, would have sufficed. The employees at the Sake on Veterans are far more professional and pleasant, so if you really have a hankering for mediocre sushi, then make the drive to that one.",1,"bad"
"5","Tiny location in a strip-mall but once you enter, the decor is light, warm, and inviting - and very spacious!  

Came here during happy hour:  buy 1 get 1 free beer or sake as well as discount prices for hot appetizers, sushi, and rolls on their check list.  

Service here was spot on - no unreasonable amount of wait time, and the refills on the hot tea was very prompt (especially since its a bit chilly, yeaaa).  

The food here was great!  Hot items came out hot and the coveted items (sushi/rolls) came right at the tail end of finishing the appetizers.

Veggie tempura -  delectable pieces of veggies deep fried in that light crispy tempura...yum!  Spicy tuna roll actually had some kick, grilled eel sushi - huge pieces of eel yum, snow crab naruto was goooooooood....no rice, just cucumber snow crab and avocado...very light and savory!  

soy wrap available - delicious!!!!  for those who are a bit wearied or tired of the same ole seaweed used in your rolls, soy wraps are a fantastic alternative and it tastes yummy and has a great clean taste.

no dessert for us, but the food and service were fantastic!!!!

omg, what a downfall!  mom and i nipped in for a bite - just had crunchy roll, tuna roll, one order of unagi sushi (grilled eel) and veggie tempura.  it took over 25 min for the rolls to come out, and we never got our veggie tempura!!!  when done eating, it took 30 min to get our check and we were charged for something we never received.  our server, gwendoly or gwendolyn wasn't paying any attention to us, just plopped the plate on our table and walked away, never asked us how we were doing or picking up our plates or anything!  another server actually gave us our ticket and when we got gwen to stop by, she didn't apologise for her mistake at all!!!!!!!!!    WTF?!  guess gwen was more worried about her 5 table top instead of us...big mistake there, 

i felt bad for her a bit b/c GM was bitching her out big time (asian men tend to look super scary when pissed, especially when it's about money) but then again, how can you fuck up the most simplest order at all?????",2,"bad"
